https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180104a.htm,Federal Reserve Board requests comment on proposed guidance that would clarify Board's supervisory expectations related to risk management for large financial institutions,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on proposed guidance that would clarify the Board's supervisory expectations related to risk management for large financial institutions. The guidance is part of a broader initiative to develop a new rating system for large financial institutions that will align with the post-crisis supervisory program. In August 2017, the Board invited comment on the proposed rating system, which would reflect assessments of a firm's capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Also in August 2017, the Board issued a proposal identifying attributes of effective boards of directors. The supervisory expectations described in today's proposed guidance, as well as those for boards of directors, would help inform the Federal Reserve's overall supervisory evaluation of a firm's governance and controls. The proposed guidance released today identifies core principles for effective senior management, who are directly accountable to the firm's board of directors for the day-to-day management of the firm. The core principles include ensuring that the firm manages its risk in a way that is prudent and consistent with its business strategy and risk management capabilities. The proposed guidance also identifies core principles for a firm's business line management and independent risk management. Business line management is responsible for the day-to-day management of specific business lines, such as residential mortgage operations. Independent risk management is responsible for conducting ongoing objective and critical assessments of a firm's risks using personnel independent of the firm's business line managers. The proposed guidance would apply to large financial institutions, including: domestic bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets; foreign banks operating in the United States with $50 billion or more in combined U.S. assets; and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for supervision by the Board. Comments on this proposal will be accepted until March 15, 2018. The Board previously extended the comment periods for the rating system and board effectiveness guidance until February 15, 2018, so that the public could comment on and understand these components together.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180110a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces Reserve Bank income and expense data and transfers to the Treasury for 2017,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced preliminary results indicating that the Reserve Banks provided for payments of approximately $80.2 billion of their estimated 2017 net income to the U.S. Treasury. The 2017 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in March and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results. The Federal Reserve Banks' 2017 estimated net income of $80.7 billion represents a decrease of $11.7 billion from 2016, primarily attributable to an increase of $13.8 billion in interest expense associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions that was partially offset by an increase of $2.5 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations. Net income for 2017 was derived primarily from $113.6 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations (U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and GSE debt securities) and foreign currency gains of $1.9 billion that result from the daily revaluation of foreign currency denominated investments at current exchange rates. The Federal Reserve Banks had interest expense of $25.9 billion primarily associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions, and incurred interest expense of $3.4 billion on securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Operating expenses of the Reserve Banks, net of amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury and other entities for services the Reserve Banks provided as fiscal agents, totaled $4.1 billion in 2017. In addition, the Reserve Banks were assessed $724 million for the costs related to producing, issuing, and retiring currency, $740 million for Board expenditures, and $573 million to fund the operations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additional earnings were derived from income from services of $442 million. Statutory dividends totaled $784 million in 2017.

In November 2015, a law was passed that requires all federal agencies to adjust their maximum civil money penalty limits annually for inflation, rather than every four years as previously required. The maximum civil money penalty limits depend on several factors, including the severity and type of violation. Additionally, the law dictates the annual adjustment formula for federal agencies. A civil money penalty is a fine imposed by a federal agency as a result of misconduct. The final rule increases the maximum civil money penalty limits for 2018.

The Board also announced civil money penalties totaling $35.1 million against five of these 10 organizations that had not yet been fined for their mortgage servicing deficiencies related to those enforcement actions. When it issued the mortgage servicing enforcement actions, the Board announced that it believed monetary penalties were appropriate for all firms subject to the actions for their mortgage servicing deficiencies. The Board previously assessed penalties against the other firms under mortgage servicing enforcement actions. With the penalties announced today, the Board has now assessed penalties totaling approximately $1.1 billion against all Federal Reserve supervised firms under mortgage servicing enforcement actions. The 10 banking organizations are: Ally Financial Inc.; Bank of America Corporation; CIT Group, Inc. (as successor to IMB HoldCo LLC); The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; HSBC North America Holdings, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Morgan Stanley; The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.; SunTrust Banks, Inc.; and U.S. Bancorp. The actions required all of the firms to improve oversight of residential mortgage loan servicing and required the firms with mortgage servicing subsidiaries supervised by the Federal Reserve to correct deficiencies in residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing. The termination of the actions was based on evidence of sustainable improvements in the firms' oversight and mortgage servicing practices. In addition, the Board announced the termination of a supplemental agreement with Ally, issued in 2012 after Ally's mortgage servicing subsidiaries sought bankruptcy protection, which addressed the parent company's contingent obligations under the 2011 enforcement action against Ally. This agreement is no longer necessary after the termination of the 2011 action announced on Friday. The civil money penalties announced today are: $14 million against Goldman Sachs; $8 million against Morgan Stanley; $5.2 million against CIT (as successor to IMB); $4.4 million against U.S. Bancorp; and $3.5 million against PNC. Also on Friday, the Board announced the termination by the Board and other federal financial regulatory agencies of joint enforcement actions issued in 2011 against Lender Processing Services, Inc. (LPS), which was succeeded by ServiceLink Holdings, LLC, and against MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., formerly known as MERSCORP, Inc. (MERS). These enforcement actions addressed deficiencies in the foreclosure-related services LPS and MERS each provided to entities regulated by the agencies. The Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are parties to the action against LPS.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180125a.htm,Agencies to give favorable Community Reinvestment Act consideration to revitalization activities in disaster areas affected by Hurricane Maria,,2018.0,"The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced they will give favorable consideration under Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations to institutions that are located outside of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, which were designated as major disaster areas in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, for bank activities that help to revitalize or stabilize these areas. The CRA encourages financial institutions to help meet local credit and community development needs. The agencies give CRA consideration for bank activities such as loans, investments, or services with a primary purpose of community development. Widespread devastation from Hurricane Maria occurred in areas that are not connected to the U.S. mainland, and the resulting economic impact and other effects may extend to other parts of the United States. The agencies therefore have determined that it is appropriate to give favorable consideration to community development activities that help to revitalize or stabilize these disaster areas by financial institutions located anywhere in the United States, provided that they have been responsive to the community development needs and opportunities of their own CRA assessment areas. Such activities may include assistance to people displaced by the hurricane, including evacuees relocated to other states. Consideration for activities that assist the disaster areas or affected individuals will be given regardless of the median income of the census tract or the personal income of the individual. However, the agencies may give greater weight to activities that are most responsive to community needs, including the needs of low- and-moderate-income areas and individuals.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180131a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12âmonth basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1â1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C.

Stress tests help make sure that banks will be able to lend to households and businesses even in a serious recession by ensuring that they have adequate capital to absorb losses. CCAR evaluates the capital planning practices and capital adequacy of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, and large U.S. operations of foreign firms, using the firms' planned capital actions such as dividend payments and share buybacks and issuances. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are a forward-looking assessment of capital sufficiency using standard assumptions across all firms. This year, 18 of the largest and most complex firms will be subject to both a quantitative evaluation of their capital adequacy and a qualitative evaluation of their capital planning capabilities, including five foreign firms with U.S. operations for the first time. Twenty firms with less complex operations, including the U.S. operations of one foreign firm, will only be subject to the quantitative portion of CCAR. The stress tests run by the firms and the Board apply three scenarios: baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. For the 2018 cycle, the severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession in which the U.S. unemployment rate rises almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent, accompanied by a steepening Treasury yield curve. The adverse scenario features a moderate recession in the United States, as well as weakening economic activity across all countries included in the scenario. The adverse and severely adverse scenarios describe hypothetical sets of events designed to assess the strength of banking organizations and their resilience. They are not forecasts. The baseline scenario is in line with average projections from surveys of economic forecasters. It does not represent the forecast of the Federal Reserve. Each scenario includes 28 variables--such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, stock market prices, and interest rates--encompassing domestic and international economic activity. Along with the variables, the Board is publishing a narrative that describes the general economic conditions in the scenarios and changes in the scenarios from the previous year. As in prior years, six bank holding companies with large trading operations will be required to factor in a global market shock as part of their scenarios. Eight firms with substantial trading or processing operations will also be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario. To support the transition to stress testing for foreign firms that are new to the evaluation, the U.S. operations of six foreign firms with significant trading activity will be subject to a simplified global market shock this year and the complete global market shock next year. Firms participating in CCAR are required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2018. The Federal Reserve will announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30, 2018, with the exact date to be announced later.

Concurrent with Fed action, Wells to replace three directors by April, one by year end",,2018.0,"Responding to recent and widespread consumer abuses and other compliance breakdowns by Wells Fargo, the Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that it would restrict the growth of the firm until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls. Concurrently with the Board's action, Wells Fargo will replace three current board members by April and a fourth board member by the end of the year. In addition to the growth restriction, the Board's consent cease and desist order with Wells Fargo requires the firm to improve its governance and risk management processes, including strengthening the effectiveness of oversight by its board of directors. Until the firm makes sufficient improvements, it will be restricted from growing any larger than its total asset size as of the end of 2017. The Board required each current director to sign the cease and desist order. ""We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again,"" Chair Janet L. Yellen said. ""The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers."" In recent years, Wells Fargo pursued a business strategy that prioritized its overall growth without ensuring appropriate management of all key risks. The firm did not have an effective firm-wide risk management framework in place that covered all key risks. This prevented the proper escalation of serious compliance breakdowns to the board of directors. The Board's action will restrict Wells Fargo's growth until its governance and risk management sufficiently improves but will not require the firm to cease current activities, including accepting customer deposits or making consumer loans. Emphasizing the need for improved director oversight of the firm, the Board has sent letters to each current Wells Fargo board member confirming that the firm's board of directors, during the period of compliance breakdowns, did not meet supervisory expectations. Letters were also sent to former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf and past lead independent director Stephen Sanger stating that their performance in those roles, in particular, did not meet the Federal Reserve's expectations.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180205a.htm,Agencies seek comment on proposed amendments to swap margin rule,,2018.0,"Five federal agencies propose to amend swap margin requirements to conform with recent rule changes that impose new restrictions on certain qualified financial contracts (QFCs) of systemically important banking organizations. Under the proposed amendments, legacy swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date would not become subject to the margin requirements if they are amended solely to comply with the requirements of the QFC Rules. The proposed amendments would also harmonize the definition of ""Eligible Master Netting Agreement"" in the Swap Margin Rule with recent changes to the definition of ""Qualifying Master Netting Agreement"" in the respective capital and liquidity regulations of the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) by recognizing the restrictions that were adopted by these agencies with respect to the QFC Rules. The Swap Margin Rule was issued in November 2015 by the Farm Credit Administration, the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve, and the OCC, and established minimum margin requirements for swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared through a clearinghouse. The margin requirements are designed to help ensure the safety and soundness of swap entities and reduce risks to the stability of the financial system associated with non-cleared swaps activity. The agencies request comments on the proposed amendments no later than 60 days after the date of their publication in the Federal Register.

Task force participants will transition into the Federal Reserve's FedPayments Improvement Community, established to provide stakeholders with opportunities to engage in the Federal Reserve's ongoing payment improvement initiatives. As described in the September release of Federal Reserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey, the enhanced FedPayments Improvement Community is designed to allow payments industry participants to tailor their involvement in Federal Reserve efforts based on interest, expertise and availability. As part of the community, task force participants will have opportunities to participate in work groups as they are established, to provide input into payments improvement efforts, and to attend online and in-person events. ""The Federal Reserve is grateful for the commitment demonstrated by these 200 industry leaders, and we are proud of the important work they've done to identify and establish payment security priorities,"" said Esther George, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who is leading the Federal Reserve's payments improvement initiatives. ""There is more work ahead, and we are counting on the payments community to continue to bring dedication and expertise to the pursuit of a more secure payment system."" Established in June 2015 in support of the Federal Reserve's Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System, the task force has engaged more than 200 financial institutions, consumer groups, payment service providers, financial technology firms, merchants, government agencies, and others interested in payment security improvement efforts. ""The task force has been a useful forum for bringing all voices to the table to discuss the very real and challenging security threats we face in the payment system,"" said Ken Montgomery, the Federal Reserve's payments security strategy leader and chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""This transition recognizes the intensity of the task force work effort over the last three years and provides greater flexibility for large numbers of stakeholders to continue participating in our improvement efforts."" Since its establishment, the Secure Payments Task Force has:  Identified key security improvement priorities of payment identity management, data protection, and information sharing to help reduce risk and fraud; Developed an online reference for payment fraud and risk information-sharing data sources, including intelligence reports, payments fraud trends, best practices and/or benchmarks; Documented payment lifecycles and security profiles (to be published in mid-March on SecurePaymentsTaskForce.org) to educate stakeholders and provide perspectives on the lifecycles of the most common payment types, including security methods, identity management controls, sensitive data involved, and relevant laws and regulations, as well as challenges and improvement opportunities related to each payment type; Contributed to the development of security-related faster payments effectiveness criteria and assessment of faster payments solution proposals for the Faster Payments Task Force; Provided feedback to the Federal Reserve on expanding fraud data reporting, resulting in an enhancement of the Federal Reserve's Payment Study.  ""The work completed in the past three years facilitates understanding and adoption of today's best practices and lays important groundwork for future collaboration to address payment system vulnerabilities,"" Montgomery said. Later this year, the Federal Reserve expects to initiate new collaborative industry work groups to advance the work begun by the task force, informed by a planned study to analyze payment fraud and security vulnerabilities, assess potential approaches to mitigate them, and identify misalignment of incentives that may hinder progress. The Federal Reserve has a wide-ranging participatory role in the payments system, helping to ensure efficiency, integrity and accessibility. The Federal Reserve promotes these qualities as a leader, catalyst for change and provider of payment services to financial institutions and the U.S. Treasury.

The proposed amendments are intended to align the rights and obligations of parties, including the Federal Reserve Banks, with the Board's 2017 amendments to Regulation CC, which reflected the evolution of the nation's check collection system from one that is largely paper-based to one that is virtually all electronic. The proposed amendments would clarify and simplify provisions of Regulation J, remove obsolete provisions, and improve consistency between Regulation J and Regulation CC. The proposed amendments would also clarify that electronically-created items (check-like items created in electronic form that never existed in paper form) are not ""items"" that the Reserve Banks are authorized to handle under Regulation J.

Last June, the Board required Capital One to resubmit its capital plan to address deficiencies in its capital planning processes. Those deficiencies included weaknesses in the way the firm shared key capital planning information with its board of directors and senior managers, identified and incorporated its unique and material risks into its capital planning, and forecasted losses and balances under stressful scenarios. The Board will continue to review and assess Capital One's progress in addressing those deficiencies in this year's CCAR submission. CCAR evaluates the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, and large U.S. operations of foreign firms, using the firms' planned capital actions such as dividend payments and share buybacks and issuances.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180321a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Lael Brainard; Loretta J. Mester; Randal K. Quarles; and John C. Williams.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180402a.htm,"Federal banking agencies issue final rule to exempt commercial real estate transactions of $500,000 or less from appraisal requirements",,2018.0,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule that increases the threshold for commercial real estate transactions requiring an appraisal from $250,000 to $500,000. The agencies originally proposed to raise the threshold, which has been in place since 1994, to $400,000, but determined that a $500,000 threshold will materially reduce regulatory burden and the number of transactions that require an appraisal. The agencies also determined that the increased threshold will not pose a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The final rule allows a financial institution to use an evaluation rather than an appraisal for commercial real estate transactions exempted by the $500,000 threshold. Evaluations provide a market value estimate of the real estate pledged as collateral, but do not have to comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraiser Practices and do not require completion by a state licensed or certified appraiser. The final rule responds, in part, to concerns financial industry representatives raised that the current threshold level had not kept pace with price appreciation in the commercial real estate market in the 24 years since the threshold was established and about regulatory burden during the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act review process completed in March 2017.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180410a.htm,Federal Reserve Board seeks comment on proposal to simplify its capital rules for large banks while preserving strong capital levels that would maintain their ability to lend under stressful conditions,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday asked for comment on a proposal that would simplify its capital rules for large banks while preserving strong capital levels that would maintain their ability to lend to households and businesses under stressful conditions. The proposal would introduce a ""stress capital buffer,"" or SCB, which would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the Board's non-stress capital requirements. The result would produce capital requirements for large banking organization that are firm-specific and risk-sensitive. ""Our regulatory measures are most effective when they are as simple and transparent as possible, and this proposal significantly simplifies our capital regime while maintaining its strength,"" Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. ""It is a good example of how our work can be done more efficiently and effectively, and in a way that bolsters the resiliency of the financial system."" Currently, bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets undergo annual supervisory stress tests run by the Board, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). CCAR requires firms to demonstrate their ability to continue to lend under hypothetical adverse economic conditions. These firms are also subject to non-stress capital requirements. The SCB would be sized through the stress test and would be part of the firm's ongoing capital requirements, producing a tailored and risk-sensitive capital regime for large banking organizations. With the proposed changes, large firms would be required to meet 14 capital-related requirements, instead of the current 24. For example, if a firm has a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 9 percent and it declines to 6 percent under the hypothetical severely adverse scenario of the stress test, its SCB for the coming year would be 3 percent. The SCB would then be added to the minimum 4.5 percent common equity capital requirement, which remains unchanged. This would result in a 7.5 percent common equity capital requirement for the coming year. If the firm is a global systemically important bank (GSIB), its GSIB surcharge--an additional cushion of capital that is held by the largest banks--would be added to the SCB. Additionally, four quarters of planned dividends would be added to the SCB. The Board estimates that, relative to current requirements, the proposed changes would generally maintain or somewhat increase the amount of capital required for GSIBs and generally decrease modestly the amount of capital required for most non-GSIBs. However, a firm's SCB will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on the firm's risk exposures and the severity of the hypothetical stress test scenarios. No firm is expected to need to raise additional capital as a result of this proposal. The Board's proposal would also modify several assumptions in the CCAR process to better align them with a firm's expected actions under stress. U.S. firms have substantially increased their capital since the first round of stress tests in 2009. The common equity capital ratio of the bank holding companies in the 2017 CCAR has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. This reflects an increase of more than $720 billion in common equity capital to a total of $1.2 trillion. Comments on the proposal will be accepted for 60 days.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180411a.htm,Rule proposed to tailor 'enhanced supplementary leverage ratio' requirements,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Wednesday proposed a rule that would further tailor leverage ratio requirements to the business activities and risk profiles of the largest domestic firms. Currently, firms that are required to comply with the ""enhanced supplementary leverage ratio"" are subject to a fixed leverage standard, regardless of their systemic footprint. The proposal would instead tie the standard to the risk-based capital surcharge of the firm, which is based on the firm's individual characteristics. The resulting leverage standard would be more closely tailored to each firm. The proposed changes seek to retain a meaningful calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards while not discouraging firms from participating in low-risk activities. The changes also correspond to recent changes proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Taking into account supervisory stress testing and existing capital requirements, agency staff estimate that the proposed changes would reduce the required amount of tier 1 capital for the holding companies of these firms by approximately $400 million, or approximately 0.04 percent in aggregate tier 1 capital. Enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards apply to all U.S. holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs), as well as the insured depository institution subsidiaries of those firms. Currently, GSIBs must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5 percent, which is the sum of the minimum 3 percent requirement plus a buffer of 2 percent, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments. The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the GSIBs must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6 percent to be considered ""well capitalized"" under the agencies' prompt corrective action framework. At the holding company level, the proposed rule would modify the fixed 2 percent buffer to be set to one half of each firm's risk-based capital surcharge. For example, if a GSIB's risk-based capital surcharge is 2 percent, it would now be required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 4 percent, which is the sum of the unchanged minimum 3 percent requirement plus a modified buffer of 1 percent. The proposal would similarly tailor the current 6 percent requirement for the insured depository institution subsidiaries of GSIBs that are regulated by the Board and OCC. Comments on the rule will be accepted for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Lael Brainard; Loretta J. Mester; Randal K. Quarles; and John C. Williams.

The strategy, published today in a report by the Bank for International Settlement's Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), sets forth an approach to reducing the risk of wholesale payments fraud related to endpoint security with the broader objective of supporting financial stability. A safe, reliable, secure and efficient wholesale payment system, which supports banks, financial market infrastructures, and other financial institutions and service providers, is an essential component of a well-functioning financial system. The seven elements of the strategy are designed to address all areas relevant to preventing, detecting, responding to, and communicating about, payments fraud. The high-level nature of the elements provides participants in the ecosystem with the flexibility to implement the strategy in accordance with their unique architecture and processes. As noted in the report, each CPMI member central bank has committed to acting as a catalyst for carrying out the strategy in its jurisdiction and actively monitoring progress. Accordingly, Federal Reserve Board staff, in close collaboration with the Federal Reserve Banks, will continue related efforts to advance the security of the wholesale payments ecosystem.

The Federal Reserve Board's latest Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households finds that economic well-being has generally improved over the past five years. The report notes that 74 percent of adults reported they were doing at least OK financially in 2017ââup 10 percentage points from the first survey in 2013. Even so, notable differences remain across race, ethnicity, education groups, and locations and many individuals still struggle to repay college loans, handle small emergency expenses, and manage retirement savings. The report draws from the Board's fifth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and examines the economic well-being and financial lives of Americans and their families. In November and December 2017, more than 12,000 people participated in the survey. They described their experiences on a wide range of topics, including income, employment, unexpected expenses, banking and credit, housing, education, and retirement planning. Among the new topics covered in this year's report is the relationship between the opioid epidemic and local economic conditions. One in five adults personally knows someone who has been addicted to opioids, and those who do have somewhat less favorable assessments of economic conditions. Still, over half of adults exposed to opioid addiction say that their local economy is good or excellent, suggesting a role for factors beyond economic conditions in understanding the crisis. ""This year's survey finds that rising levels of employment are translating into improved financial conditions for many but not all Americans, with one third now reporting they are living comfortably and another 40 percent reporting they are doing ok financially,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard. ""Even with the improvement in financial outlook, however, 40 percent still say they cannot cover a $400 emergency expense, or would do so by borrowing or selling something. We learned that about one in five adults knows someone with addiction to opioids or painkillers; whites are about twice as likely to have such exposure as blacks and Hispanics; and exposure does not vary much by education level or by local economic conditions."" The Board's SHED data looks at how individuals are managing their finances and making decisions vital to their financial lives and futures. Alongside the economic gains observed since the Great Recession, this report also notes challenges faced by people who are trying to piece together multiple jobs or who are struggling to establish emergency savings. The Board will continue to follow these developments. Among the report's other key findings:  Individuals of all education levels, races, and ethnicities have shared in the economic expansion over the past five years, although reported well-being remains lower for racial and ethnic minorities and those with less educational attainment Most workers are satisfied with the wages and benefits from their current job and are optimistic about their future job opportunities. Even so, challenges including irregular job scheduling remain. One in six workers have irregular work schedules that they did not request, and one in ten receive their work schedule less than a week in advance Many adults are struggling to save for retirement, and less than two-fifths believe that they are on track with their savings. While preparedness for retirement increases with age, concerns about inadequate savings are still common for those nearing retirement Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money. This is an improvement from half of adults in 2013 being ill-prepared for such an expense  Other data on urban and rural geographic differences and national and local views are also in the report.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180530a.htm,"Federal Reserve Board asks for comment on proposed rule to simplify and tailor compliance requirements relating to the ""Volcker rule""",,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday asked for comment on a proposed rule to simplify and tailor compliance requirements relating to the ""Volcker rule."" By statute, the Volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning or controlling hedge funds or private equity funds. Since regulations implementing the Volcker rule were finalized in December 2013 by five federal agencies, experience has shown that the complexity of the rule has created compliance uncertainty for firms subject to the rule. The proposed changes are intended to streamline the rule by eliminating or modifying requirements that are not necessary to effectively implement the statute, without diminishing the safety and soundness of banking entities. ""The agencies responsible for implementing the rule see many opportunities to simplify it and improve it in ways that will allow firms to conduct appropriate activities without undue burden and without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Chairman Jerome H. Powell said. ""The proposal will address some of the uncertainty and complexity that now make it difficult for firms to know how best to comply, and for supervisors to know that they are in compliance."" The proposed changes were jointly developed by all five agencies responsible for administration of the Volcker rule--the Federal Reserve Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Specifically, the proposed changes would:  Tailor the rule's compliance requirements based on the size of a firm's trading assets and liabilities, with the most stringent requirements applied to firms with the most trading activity; Provide more clarity by revising the definition of ""trading account"" in the rule, in part by relying on commonly used accounting definitions; Clarify that firms that trade within appropriately developed internal risk limits are engaged in permissible market making or underwriting activity; Streamline the criteria that apply when a banking entity seeks to rely on the hedging exemption from the proprietary trading prohibition; Limit the impact of the Volcker rule on the foreign activity of foreign banks; and Simplify the trading activity information that banking entities are required to provide to the agencies.  ""The specific elements of this proposal are drawn from experience--the shared experience of all five responsible agencies and of policymakers at those agencies with wide and varied backgrounds during the four years that the Volcker rule regulations have been in force,"" said Randal K. Quarles, the Board's Vice Chairman for Supervision. ""By focusing the application of the rule on those firms with the highest levels of activity covered by the statue, and by clarifying and simplifying the compliance regime, we can promote safety and soundness while reducing unnecessary burdens."" The recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act made several changes to the statutory Volcker rule provisions. Among other things, the Act exempted community banks--firms with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and with total trading assets and liabilities that are not more than five percent of total consolidated assets--from the Volcker rule restrictions. Formal implementation of the Volcker rule-related changes contained in the Act will occur in a separate rulemaking by the agencies.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180613a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Like the proposed rule, a global systemically important bank holding company, or GSIB, would be limited to a credit exposure of no more than 15 percent of the GSIB's tier 1 capital to another systemically important financial firm, reflecting Board staff's analysis of the increased systemic risk posed when the largest firms have significant exposure to one another. ""This final rule is another step in sustaining an effective and efficient regulatory regime that keeps our financial system strong and protects our economy while imposing no more burden than is necessary to get the job done,"" Chairman Jerome H. Powell said. Like the proposal, a bank holding company with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets would be restricted to a credit exposure of no more than 25 percent of its tier 1 capital to a counterparty. Foreign banks operating in the U.S. with $250 billion or more in total global consolidated assets, and their intermediate holding companies (IHCs) with $50 billion or more in total U.S. consolidated assets, would be subject to similar limits. ""The final rule adds to the robust capital and liquidity positions of the financial system today by setting out clear limits on credit exposures among the largest banking firms,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said. ""I am pleased by the final rule's efficient approach to setting limits that are appropriately adjusted for firms of lesser systemic importance."" Consistent with the recently passed Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the limits in the final rule will apply only to GSIBs and bank holding companies with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets. The Board will consider the extent to which additional standards, including credit exposure limits, should apply to holding companies with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion at a later date. In response to comments, the final rule reduces regulatory burden by using common accounting definitions to simplify application of the exposure limits. In addition, a foreign bank's combined U.S. operations, though not its U.S. IHC, will be considered in compliance with the final rule if a comparable rule is in effect in the foreign bank's home country. GSIBs will be required to comply by January 1, 2020, and all other firms are required to comply by July 1, 2020. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180615a.htm,Agencies issue host state loan-to-deposit ratios,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON--The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued the host state loan-to-deposit ratios that they will use to determine compliance with section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. These ratios replace the prior year's ratios, which were released on June 21, 2017. In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio test that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state. A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches. A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate agency. The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180621a.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases results of supervisory bank stress tests,,2018.0,"The nation's largest bank holding companies are strongly capitalized and would be able to lend to households and businesses during a severe global recession, according to the results of supervisory stress tests released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Board. The most severe hypothetical scenario projects $578 billion in total losses for the 35 participating bank holding companies during the nine quarters tested. The ""severely adverse"" scenario, the most stringent scenario yet used in the Board's stress tests, features a severe global recession with the U.S. unemployment rate rising by almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent, accompanied by a steepening Treasury yield curve. The firms' aggregate common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets, would fall from an actual level of 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to a minimum level of 7.9 percent in the hypothetical stress scenario. Since 2009, the 35 firms have added about $800 billion in common equity capital. ""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said. Several factors affected the post-stress capital ratios this year. Credit card balances are generally higher, producing increased losses under stress, totaling $113 billion this year. Additionally, recent changes to the tax code affected the firms and the effects were different across the firms. Several firms had immediate, one-time declines in their starting capital ratios because of certain accounting consequences of the tax changes. The tax law also eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that tended to raise post-tax income in times of stress. Capital is critical to banking organizations, the financial system, and the economy, because it acts as a cushion to absorb losses and helps to ensure that losses are borne by shareholders. The Board's stress scenarios assume deliberately stringent and conservative hypothetical economic and financial market conditions. The results are not forecasts or expected outcomes. This is the eighth round of stress tests led by the Federal Reserve since 2009 and the sixth round required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The 35 firms tested this year represent about 80 percent of the assets of all banks operating in the U.S. The Federal Reserve uses its own independent projections of losses and incomes for each firm. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are one component of the Federal Reserve's analysis during the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which is an annual exercise to evaluate the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of large bank holding companies. CCAR results will be released on Thursday, June 28, at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Also on Thursday, the Board announced that to be consistent with the recently passed Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets are no longer subject to supervisory stress testing, including both the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests and CCAR. As a result, the Board will not include CIT Group Inc., Comerica Incorporated, and Zions Bancorporation in this year's results and future cycles. The Board will have further information on its implementation of the new law at a later date. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180628a.htm,Federal Reserve releases findings from study of small business owners' perspectives on online lenders and products,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland on Thursday published Browsing to Borrow: ""Mom & Pop"" Small Business Perspectives on Online Lenders. The report examines small business owners' perceptions of online lenders and their understanding and interpretation of the information that online lenders use to describe their credit products. Among the key findings from the study, most participants were aware of the products offered by online lenders. Although some had positive views, participants also had negative impressions of the industry. While browsing the websites of online lenders, participants generally reacted favorably to those with detailed product information and were often skeptical of those that withheld product details. When presented with sample online products, participants generally found the descriptions difficult to understand or lacking detail about costs and features. Many of the small business owners participating in the study indicated a need for clear disclosure of product costs and terms. The findings suggest that improved disclosures could benefit both borrowers and lenders. Clear disclosures could enable borrowers to better evaluate products suitable for their businesses and could help lenders engender trust and grow their customer base. The study explores small business owners' perceptions of nonbank online lenders as they are becoming more mainstream alternative providers of financing to small firms. For this study, Federal Reserve researchers conducted online focus groups with 42 small business owners from across the United States who had at least one but no more than 20 employees; had less than $2 million in annual revenues; and had sought credit for their businesses in the prior 12 months. The study follows the release of a 2015 report, Alternative Lending through the Eyes of ""Mom & Pop"" Small-Business Owners: Findings from Online Focus Groups.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180628a.htm,Federal Reserve releases results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR),,2018.0,"As part of its annual examination of the capital planning practices of the nation's largest banks, the Federal Reserve Board on Thursday did not object to the capital plans of 34 firms and objected to the capital plan of one firm. Due in part to recent changes to the tax law that negatively affected capital levels, two firms will maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years. Separately, one firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress. The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, in its eighth year, evaluates the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of the largest U.S.-based bank holding companies, including the firms' planned capital actions, such as dividend payments and share buybacks. Strong capital levels act as a cushion to absorb losses and help ensure that banking organizations have the ability to lend to households and businesses even in times of stress. ""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles. When evaluating a firm's capital plan, the Board considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include a firm's projected capital ratios under a hypothetical scenario of severe economic and financial market stress. Qualitative factors include the strength of the firm's capital planning process, which incorporates risk management, internal controls, and governance practices that support the process. This year, 18 of the largest and most complex banks were subject to both the quantitative and qualitative assessments. The 17 other firms in CCAR were subject only to the quantitative assessment. The Board may object to a capital plan based on quantitative or qualitative concerns. The Board objected to the capital plan from DB USA Corporation due to qualitative concerns. Those concerns include material weaknesses in the firm's data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress. The Board issued a conditional non-objection to the capital plans of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and both firms will maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years, which will allow them to build capital over the next year. Each firm's capital ratios, under the capital plans they originally submitted and with the one-time capital reduction from the tax law changes, fell below required levels when subjected to the hypothetical scenario. This one-time reduction does not reflect a firm's performance under stress and firms can expect higher post-tax earnings going forward. The Board also issued a conditional non-objection for the capital plan from State Street Corporation. The stress test revealed counterparty exposures that produced large losses under the hypothetical scenario, which assumes the default of a firm's largest counterparty under stress. The firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress. The Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plans of Ally Financial, Inc.; American Express Company; BB&T Corporation; BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc.; BMO Financial Corp.; BNP Paribas USA; Bank of America Corporation; The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation; Barclays US LLC.; Capital One Financial Corporation; Citigroup, Inc.; Citizens Financial Group; Credit Suisse Holdings (USA); Discover Financial Services; Fifth Third Bancorp; HSBC North America Holdings, Inc.; Huntington Bancshares, Inc.; JP Morgan Chase & Co.; Keycorp; M&T Bank Corporation; MUFG Americas Holdings Corporation; Northern Trust Corp.; The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.; RBC USA Holdco Corporation; Regions Financial Corporation; Santander Holdings USA, Inc.; SunTrust Banks, Inc.; TD Group US Holdings LLC; U.S. Bancorp; UBS Americas Holdings LLC; and Wells Fargo & Company. U.S. firms have substantially increased their capital since the first round of stress tests led by the Federal Reserve in 2009. The common equity capital ratio--which compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets--of the 35 bank holding companies in the 2018 CCAR has more than doubled from 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. This reflects an increase of more than $800 billion in common equity capital to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180629a.htm,Agencies seek comment on proposed 2019 resolution plan guidance,,2018.0,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced they are seeking public comment on revised resolution plan guidance for the eight largest, most complex U.S. banks. Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. The resolution planning process helps ensure that a firm's failure would not have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. The proposed guidance would apply beginning with the July 1, 2019 resolution plan submissions of the firms. The proposed guidance is largely similar to the guidance issued by the agencies in April 2016, with updates to the agencies' expectations for how a firm's resolution strategy should address derivatives and trading activities, and the firm's payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) activities. The update to the derivatives guidance sets expectations for firms regarding their capability to book, monitor, and identify their derivatives exposures, including for exposures that transfer risks between affiliates. The proposed guidance also reduces burden by eliminating certain information requirements. The proposed PCS update directs firms in their resolution planning to take account of both the firm's role as a user of PCS services and as a provider of PCS services for clients. Comments on this proposal will be accepted for 60 days after the proposal's publication in the Federal Register.

If approved, the proposed action would replace the Fedwire Funds Service's current, proprietary message format. Potential benefits to the adoption of the ISO 20022 message format include enhanced efficiency of both domestic and cross-border payments between the Fedwire Funds Service and other payment or messaging systems as well as a richer set of payment data that could help banks and other entities meet evolving requirements to screen payments for sanctions and anti-money laundering purposes. The proposed migration to the ISO 20022 message format would take place in three phases beginning in 2020 and ending in 2023. The Fedwire Funds Service is a real-time gross settlement system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks. It enables participants to make final payments using their balances held at Reserve Banks or intraday credit provided by the Reserve Banks. The Fedwire Funds Service currently uses a proprietary message format that supports multiple types of payments- related communications. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental organization comprised of 161 national standards bodies that publishes standards for a broad range of industries. Many foreign wire transfer systems, including those used by key U.S. trading partners, have already adopted ISO 20022. The Federal Reserve, in its 2015 Strategies for Improving the Payment System paper recommended that the U.S. payments industry develop a strategy for adopting the ISO 20022 message format for U.S. payment transactions. Subsequent public and industry engagement and outreach indicate that the migration could be beneficial for Fedwire Funds Service participants. The Board's notice is attached.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180801a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H. Powell, Chairman; John C. Williams, Vice Chairman; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Lael Brainard; Esther L. George; Loretta J.

These amendments continue the Board's efforts to update Regulation CC to reflect the evolution of the nation's check collection system from one that is largely paper-based to one that is virtually all electronic. In today's check collection environment, original paper checks may be unavailable for inspection in certain disputes between banks. When the original check is not available, the final amendments update Regulation CC to include a presumption that a substitute or electronic check was altered in certain cases of doubt. The presumption applies only to disputes between banks and only when one bank has transferred an electronic or substitute check to the other bank. As with existing rules under Regulation CC, the parties may, by mutual agreement, vary the effect of the amendments' provisions. In addition, the final amendments clarify that the presumption does not apply if it is contrary to another federal statute or regulation, such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury's rules regarding U.S. Treasury checks. The amendments become effective January 1, 2019. The Board's Federal Register notice is attached. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955    Federal Register notice HTML | PDF",20180912,210

The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at www.fema.gov. Lending: Financial institutions should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Florence. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings. This evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, which requires judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructuring. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricane Florence, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions may face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Florence. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricane Florence. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Florence may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations, as applicable. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Hurricane Florence that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the effects of Hurricane Florence. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180921a.htm,Agencies approve amendments to swap margin rule ,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON--Five federal agencies approved final amendments to swap margin requirements to conform with recent rule changes that impose new restrictions on certain qualified financial contracts of systemically important banking organizations (QFC Rules). Under the amendments, legacy swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date will not become subject to the margin requirements if they are amended solely to comply with the requirements of the QFC Rules. The amendments harmonize the definition of ""Eligible Master Netting Agreement"" in the swap margin rule with recent changes to the definition of ""Qualifying Master Netting Agreement"" in the respective capital and liquidity regulations of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) by recognizing the restrictions that were adopted by these agencies with respect to the QFC Rules. The swap margin rule was issued in November 2015 by the Farm Credit Administration, the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve, and the OCC and established minimum margin requirements for swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared through a clearinghouse. The margin requirements are designed to help ensure the safety and soundness of swap entities and reduce risks to the stability of the financial system associated with non-cleared swaps activity. The final amendments are effective 30 days after the publication date in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.

Act). The proposal reflects the transferal of the Board's rulemaking authority for the S.A.F.E. Act to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau). Entities that were subject to the Board's rules are now subject to the Bureau's rules. The S.A.F.E. Act mandates a nationwide licensing and registration system for residential mortgage loan originators. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act transferred rulemaking authority for the S.A.F.E. Act to the Bureau from the Board, the other federal banking agencies, and the Farm Credit Administration. Because the Bureau has already issued a final rule that is substantially identical to the Board's regulations that incorporate the S.A.F.E. Act, the Board is proposing to repeal its versions of those regulations.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180926a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20181003a.htm,Federal Reserve Board seeks public comment on potential actions to facilitate real-time interbank settlement of faster payments,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday invited public comment on actions the Federal Reserve could take to support faster payments in the United States. The potential actions, which would facilitate real-time interbank settlement of faster payments, build on collaborative work with the payment industry through the Federal Reserve System's Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System (SIPS) initiative. Faster payment services are valued for the conveniences they provide, such as the ability to pay another individual on-the-spot using a mobile phone application. They also provide consumers, households, and businesses more flexibility in managing their money because faster payments can be sent and received at any time, on any day. Views are being sought on two potential actions that may support the further development of faster payments in the United States while increasing the resiliency and security of services offered to the public: 1) the development of a service for real-time interbank settlement of faster payments 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year (24x7x365); and 2) the creation of a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers between Federal Reserve accounts on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real-time interbank settlement of faster payments, regardless of whether those services are provided by the private sector or the Federal Reserve Banks. The Board is not committing to any specific action and is seeking input on which, if any, actions the Federal Reserve should take. ""Consumers and businesses increasingly expect to be able to send and immediately receive payments at any time of the day, any day of the year,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard. ""A 24/7 economy with 24/7 real-time payments needs 24/7 real-time settlement. That is where we believe that the Federal Reserve and the private sector together need to make investments for the future."" Real-time settlement avoids interbank credit risk by aligning the speed of interbank settlement with the speed of underlying payments. As a result, broad use of real-time settlement for faster payments could enhance the overall safety of the faster payments market in the United States. Development of a nationwide real-time interbank settlement infrastructure by the Federal Reserve could encourage more banks to develop faster payment services, creating more choice for consumers, households, and businesses. A liquidity management tool could improve the level of participation by banks in a real-time settlement infrastructure for faster payments, and hence public access to faster payment services, by mitigating risk that can arise for banks outside of standard business hours.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181003a.htm,Federal agencies issue a joint statement on banks and credit unions sharing resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness of Bank Secrecy Act compliance,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON--The federal depository institutions regulators and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today issued a statement to address instances in which certain banks and credit unions may decide to enter into collaborative arrangements to share resources to manage their Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) obligations more efficiently and effectively. Collaborative arrangements as described in the statement generally are most suitable for financial institutions with a community focus, less complex operations, and lower-risk profiles for money laundering or terrorist financing. The statement, which was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FinCEN, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, explains how these institutions can share BSA/AML resources in order to better protect against illicit finance risks, which can in turn also reduce costs. Today's joint statement is a result of a working group recently formed by these agencies and Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the BSA/AML regime. ""This joint statement is part of a broader effort to work closely with our regulatory partners to strengthen the anti-money laundering defenses across the U.S. financial system,"" said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The joint statement allows community-focused banks and credit unions to share certain anti-money laundering resources in order to better protect against illicit actors seeking to abuse those types of institutions. Such resource sharing must be approached with careful due diligence and thorough consideration of the risks and benefits."" Among other things, today's joint statement aims to:  Highlight the potential benefits of collaborative arrangements that pool resources, such as staff, technology, or other resources, to increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and leverage specialized expertise; and Outline risk considerations and mitigation measures associated with the use of collaborative arrangements.  The joint statement acknowledges that banks and credit unions may benefit from using shared resources to manage certain BSA/AML obligations more efficiently and effectively. However, it notes that financial institutions should approach the establishment of collaborative arrangements like other business decisions, with due diligence and thorough consideration of the risks and benefits. Banks and credit unions are encouraged to contact their primary federal regulator with questions regarding sharing BSA resources, and should refer to other relevant guidance.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20181016a.htm,Federal Reserve Payments Study finds U.S. payments fraud a small but growing fraction of overall payments,,2018.0,"The value of fraudulent noncash payments in the United States rose significantly between 2012 and 2015--outpacing growth in noncash payments overall, according to a new report based on Federal Reserve Payments Study data. The study's survey of depository institutions found that the value of noncash payments fraud rose 37 percent from $6.1 billion in 2012 to $8.3 billion in 2015. Over the same period, the total value of noncash payments rose 12 percent from $161.2 trillion to $180.3 trillion. The report provides estimates of payments fraud totals and rates for payments processed over general-purpose credit and debit card networks, including non-prepaid and prepaid debit card networks, the automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfer system, and the check clearing system. These payment systems form the core of the noncash payment and settlement systems used to clear and settle everyday payments made by consumers and businesses in the United States. The fraud data were collected as part of Federal Reserve surveys of depository institutions in 2012 and 2015 and payment card networks in 2015 and 2016. The types of fraudulent payments covered in the study are those made by an unauthorized third party. Data from the depository institutions survey show that the overall rate of payments fraud, by value, increased from 2012 to 2015 in the United States, driven primarily by card fraud. According to the payment card networks, the rate of card fraud, by value, was nearly flat from 2015 to 2016, with the rate of in-person card fraud decreasing notably and the rate of remote card fraud increasing significantly. Even so, both surveys found that card payments fraud, at less than one-tenth of a percent of all card payments, is rare, and also represents a small fraction of the value of card payments. Among the key findings of the depository institution survey:  The 2015 payments fraud rate, by value, was more than 20 percent larger than in 2012, while the 2015 fraud rate, by number, was nearly 70 percent larger than in 2012 There was an estimated 46 cents of payments fraud for every $10,000 of payments in 2015, compared to 38 cents of payments fraud for every $10,000 of payments in 2012 The value of fraudulent card payments and automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals rose from an estimated $4 billion in 2012 to $6.5 billion in 2015 Card fraud, by value, accounted for more than three-fourths of noncash payments fraud in 2015, rising from less than two-thirds in 2012 Check fraud, by value, declined to $710 million in 2015 from $1.1 billion in 2012 The value of ACH fraud rose to $1.2 billion in 2015 from $1 billion in 2012, but the fraud rate was little changed  Data from the card network survey, which covered general-purpose credit and debit (non-prepaid and prepaid) card payments, but did not include ATM withdrawals, show that while the value of total card fraud increased, the fraud rate stabilized, recording a negligible decline from 2015 to 2016. In particular, card payments fraud increased from $7.1 billion in 2015 to $7.5 billion in 2016. The value of credit card fraud in both years was more than double that of debit card fraud, and the fraud rate for credit cards in both years was substantially higher than for debit cards. Among the key findings of the card network survey:  For every $10,000 of payments in 2015 and 2016, credit card fraud increased from $16.95 to $17.13, while debit card fraud decreased from $9.61 to $9.15 The combined fraud rate of credit and debit cards declined negligibly from $13.55 for every $10,000 of payments in 2015 to $13.45 in 2016 In-person card fraud decreased from $3.7 billion in 2015 to $2.9 billion in 2016 while remote card fraud grew from $3.4 billion to $4.6 billion The total number of fraudulent card payments increased from 63.5 million in 2015 to 71.4 million in 2016. Fraudulent debit card payments increased from 4.3 for every 10,000 payments in 2015 to 4.6 in 2016, while fraudulent credit card payments were flat at 11.7 for every 10,000 payments in both 2015 and 2016 Fraud using counterfeit cards declined from $3 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2016, coinciding with a sharp increase in the use of cards with microchips for in-person payments from 2015 to 2016 Driven by the adoption of chip card technology, the share in the value of in-person payments using a chip instead of a magnetic strip increased from 3.2 percent in 2015 to 26.4 percent in 2016  The report is a collaborative project of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It is intended to foster a better understanding of developments in the payments system, and to inform efforts to improve the U.S. payments infrastructure.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181025a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces annual indexing of reserve requirement exemption amount and of low reserve tranche for 2019,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the annual indexing of two amounts used in determining reserve requirements of depository institutions. These amounts are the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche. All depository institutions must hold a percentage of certain types of deposits as reserves in the form of vault cash, as a deposit in a Federal Reserve Bank, or as a deposit in a pass-through account at a correspondent institution. Reserve requirements currently are assessed on the depository institution's net transaction accounts (mostly checking accounts). Depository institutions must also regularly submit reports of their deposits and other reservable liabilities. For net transaction accounts in 2019, the first $16.3 million, up from $16.0 million in 2018, will be exempt from reserve requirements. A 3 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts over $16.3 million up to and including $124.2 million, up from $122.3 million in 2018. A 10 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million. These annual adjustments, known as the reserve requirement exemption amount adjustment and the low reserve tranche adjustment, are based on growth in total reservable liabilities and net transaction accounts, respectively, at all depository institutions between June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2018. The new low reserve tranche and reserve requirement exemption amount will apply to the 14-day reserve maintenance period that begins January 17, 2019. For depository institutions that report deposit data weekly, this maintenance period corresponds to the 14-day computation period that begins Tuesday, December 18, 2018. For depository institutions that report deposit data quarterly, this maintenance period corresponds to the seven-day computation period that begins Tuesday, December 18, 2018. The Board also announced changes in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency with which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181030a.htm,Agencies propose rule to update calculation of derivative contract exposure amounts under regulatory capital rules,,2018.0,"Three federal banking agencies on Tuesday invited public comment on a proposal to update their standards for how firms measure counterparty credit risk posed by derivative contracts under the agencies' regulatory capital rules. The proposed changes are designed to better reflect the current derivatives market and incorporate risks observed during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The proposal, jointly issued by the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, would provide the ""standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk,"" also known as ""SA-CCR"" as an alternative approach to the agencies' current exposure methodology, or CEM, for calculating derivative exposure under the agencies' regulatory capital rules. SA-CCR better reflects the current derivatives market and would provide important improvements to risk sensitivity, resulting in more appropriate capital requirements for derivative contracts exposure. The ""advanced approaches"" banking organizations--firms that have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure--would be required to use SA-CCR for purposes of calculating both standardized total risk-weighted assets and the supplementary leverage ratio. Non-advanced approaches banking organizations would be allowed to use either CEM or SA-CCR to determine the exposure amount for derivative contracts. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181031a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on framework that would more closely match regulations for large banking organizations with their risk profiles,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday invited public comment on a framework that would more closely match the regulations for large banking organizations with their risk profiles. The changes would reduce compliance requirements for firms with less risk while maintaining more stringent requirements for firms with more risk. The framework establishes four categories of standards for large banking organizations--those with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The proposals build on the Board's existing tailoring of its rules and would be consistent with changes from the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act. ""The proposals would prescribe materially less stringent requirements on firms with less risk, while maintaining the most stringent requirements for firms that pose the greatest risks to the financial system and our economy,"" Chairman Jerome H. Powell said. The changes would significantly reduce regulatory compliance requirements for firms in the lowest risk category, modestly reduce requirements for firms in the next lowest risk category, and largely keep existing requirements in place for the largest and most complex firms in the highest risk categories. ""With these proposals, banking organizations will see reduced regulatory complexity and easier compliance with no material decline in the strength of the U.S. banking system,"" Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. Firms would be sorted into categories based on several factors, including asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Each factor reflects greater complexity and risk to a banking organization, resulting in greater risk to the financial system and broader economy. Firms in the lowest risk category--generally most domestic firms with $100 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets--would no longer be subject to standardized liquidity requirements. They would remain subject to firm-developed liquidity stress tests and regulatory liquidity risk management standards. Additionally, these firms would no longer be required to conduct company-run stress tests, and their supervisory stress tests would be moved to a two-year cycle, rather than annual. These reduced requirements would reflect the lower risk profile of these firms. Firms in the next lowest risk category--generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, or material levels of the other risk factors, that are not global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs)--would have their standardized liquidity requirements reduced to reflect their more stable funding profile but remain subject to a range of enhanced liquidity standards. In addition, the firms would be required to conduct company-run stress tests on a two-year cycle, rather than semi-annually. The firms would remain subject to annual supervisory stress tests. Firms in the highest risk categories--including the GSIBs--would not see any changes to their capital or liquidity requirements. Taken together, the Board estimates that the changes would result in a 0.6 percent decrease in required capital and a reduction of 2.5 percent of liquid assets for all U.S. banking firms with assets of $100 billion or more. The regulatory capital and liquidity aspects of the proposals were jointly developed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A separate tailoring proposal affecting foreign banks will be released in the future. The attached chart shows the proposed requirements for each category, as well as a list of firms projected to be included in each category. Comments will be accepted through January 22, 2019.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20181108a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2-1/4 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181115b.htm,Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions and their customers affected by California wildfires,,2018.0,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the California Department of Business Oversight recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires on the customers, members, and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at www.fema.gov. Lending: Financial institutions should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings. This evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, which requires judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructuring. In supervising institutions affected by the wildfires, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions may face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the wildfires. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the wildfires. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by wildfires may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations, as applicable. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by the wildfires that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the effects of the wildfires. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions, as applicable, may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the wildfires. Institutions should monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the wildfires. Appropriate monitoring and prudent efforts to stabilize such investments are encouraged.

The amendments align the rights and obligations of parties, including the Federal Reserve Banks, with the Board's 2017 amendments to Regulation CC, which reflected the evolution of the nation's check collection system from one that is largely paper-based to one that is virtually all electronic. The amendments also clarify and simplify provisions of Regulation J, remove obsolete provisions, and improve consistency between Regulation J and Regulation CC. Finally, the amendments clarify that electronically-created items (check-like items created in electronic form that never existed in paper form) are not ""items"" that the Reserve Banks are authorized to handle under Regulation J. The Board has also amended Regulation J to clarify that financial messaging standards for Fedwire funds transfers, such as the international common format standard ISO 20022, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities with respect to Fedwire funds transfers.

The Reserve Banks project that they will recover 100.9 percent of their priced services costs in 2019. The Reserve Banks expect to fully recover actual and imputed expenses, including profit that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, the Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes will result in a 2.5 percent average price increase. The Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes will result in a 4.0 percent average price increase for check-clearing customers; a 2.0 percent average price increase for Fedwire® Funds customers; and a 6.0 average price increase for Fedwire® Securities customers. The fees will remain unchanged for the Reserve Banks' FedACH® Services and National Settlement Service. Lastly, the Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes will result in a 7.5 percent average price increase for FedLine® Solutions customers. The 2019 fee schedule for each of the priced services is available on the Federal Reserve Banks' financial services website at FRBservices.orgSM. The Board also approved the 2019 private-sector adjustment factor (PSAF) of $17.8 million for Reserve Bank priced services. The PSAF is an allowance for income taxes and other imputed expenses that would have been paid and profit that would have been earned if the Reserve Banks' priced services were provided by a private business. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 requires that the Federal Reserve establish fees to recover the costs of providing priced services, including imputed costs, over the long run, to promote competition between the Reserve Banks and private-sector service providers.

The Federal Reserve fined Société Générale for having insufficient policies and procedures to ensure that the activities conducted at its offices outside of the United States complied with U.S. sanctions laws.

The Federal Reserve's order also prohibits Société Générale from re-employing the individuals involved in the past actions or retaining them as consultants or contractors, and will require the firm to fully cooperate, and provide substantial assistance, in any ongoing investigations related to the individuals involved in the misconduct in this case. The Federal Reserve's order is being taken in conjunction with actions by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney's Office, and the New York Department of Financial Services for violations of U.S. sanctions requirements and various New York state laws.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181120a.htm,Agencies propose amendments to Regulation CC regarding funds availability,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the Federal Reserve Board today jointly proposed amendments to Regulation CC that would implement a statutory requirement to adjust for inflation the amount of funds depository institutions must make available to their customers. The amendments would apply in circumstances ranging from next business day withdrawal of certain check deposits to setting the threshold amount for determining whether an account has been repeatedly withdrawn. Regulation CC implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (EFA Act). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the EFA Act to grant the Bureau and the Board joint rulemaking authority for funds-availability schedules, disclosure policies, payment of interest, and other EFA Act provisions implemented by Regulation CC. The Dodd-Frank Act amendments require that the EFA Act's dollar amounts be inflation adjusted every five years by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The first set of proposed adjustments are detailed in the attached Federal Register notice.  To help ensure that institutions have sufficient time to implement the adjustments, the agencies propose a compliance date that would be at least 12 months after publication of a final rule in the Federal Register. The agencies also propose to implement in Regulation CC, EFA Act amendments made by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which include extending coverage of the EFA Act to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Finally, the agencies are providing an additional opportunity for public comment on certain funds-availability amendments in subpart B of Regulation CC that the Board published in 2011 regarding funds availability schedule provisions and associated definitions.  In taking this step, the agencies have not made a decision on whether to make any aspects of the 2011 proposal final. Reopening the comment period will provide the agencies with up-to-date public views to consider. The agencies are accepting comments on all aspects of the proposed amendments for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181121a.htm,Agencies announce threshold for smaller loan exemption from appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today announced that the threshold for exempting loans from special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans during 2019 will increase from $26,000 to $26,700. The threshold amount will be effective January 1, 2019, and is based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as of June 1, 2018. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the Truth in Lending Act to add special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, including a requirement that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the home's interior before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less and also provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the CPI-W. If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181121b.htm,Agencies announce dollar thresholds in Regulations Z and M for exempt consumer credit and lease transactions,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) today announced the dollar thresholds in Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) and Regulation M (Consumer Leasing) that will apply for determining exempt consumer credit and lease transactions in 2019. These thresholds are set pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act that require adjusting these thresholds annually based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2018, the protections of the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $57,200 or less in 2019. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property (such as mortgages) are subject to the Truth in Lending Act regardless of the amount of the loan. Although the Dodd-Frank Act generally transferred rulemaking authority under the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act to the Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board retains authority to issue rules for certain motor vehicle dealers.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181121c.htm,Agencies propose community bank leverage ratio for qualifying community banking organizations,,2018.0,"Three federal banking agencies on Wednesday invited public comment on a proposal that would simplify regulatory capital requirements for qualifying community banking organizations, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The proposal would provide regulatory burden relief to qualifying community banking organizations by giving them an option to calculate a simple leverage ratio, rather than multiple measures of capital adequacy. Under the proposal, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9 percent. A qualifying community banking organization that has chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements. A firm would also be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well capitalized for the agencies' prompt corrective action rules provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9 percent. The proposal was jointly issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

The agencies will not penalize firms that maintain effective anti-money laundering programs but choose not to pursue innovative approaches.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181204a.htm,Agencies seek public comment on proposal to raise appraisal exemption threshold for residential real estate transactions,,2018.0,"The three federal banking agencies announced they are seeking public comment on a proposal to raise the threshold for residential real estate transactions requiring an appraisal from $250,000 to $400,000. The appraisal threshold has remained unchanged since 1994, and the agencies believe an increase would provide burden relief without posing a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. All three agencies have approved the proposal, with the FDIC and the OCC acting on November 20. Comments will be accepted until 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. Rather than requiring an appraisal for transactions exempted by the threshold, the proposal would require the use of an evaluation consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Evaluations provide an estimate of the market value of real estate but could be less burdensome than appraisals because the agencies' appraisal regulations do not require evaluations to be prepared by state licensed or certified appraisers. In addition, evaluations are typically less detailed and costly than appraisals. Evaluations have been required for transactions exempted from the appraisal requirement by the current residential threshold since the 1990s. This proposal responds, in part, to comments the agencies received during their recent review of regulations that the current exemption level for residential transactions had not kept pace with price appreciation. Additionally, the proposal would incorporate the appraisal exemption for rural residential properties provided by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act and similarly require evaluations for these transactions. In addition, the proposal would require institutions to appropriately review all appraisals required by the agencies' appraisal rules to ensure their compliance with appraisal industry standards.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20181219a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2018.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2â1/2 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H. Powell, Chairman; John C. Williams, Vice Chairman; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181220b.htm,Agencies propose update to management interlock rules,,2018.0,"The federal banking agencies on Thursday invited public comment on a proposal to update rules restricting the ability of a director or other management official to serve at more than one depository institution or depository holding company. The proposed changes would provide relief for community banks and better align with other rules. The current management interlock rules prohibit a director or other management official working at a depository organization--a term defined by regulation to mean either a depository institution or a depository holding company--with more than $2.5 billion in total assets from serving at the same time at an unaffiliated depository organization with more than $1.5 billion in total assets. The current thresholds were established by statutory amendment in 1996. The proposal seeks comment on raising both thresholds to $10 billion in total assets, given the consolidation and growth in the industry over the past 20 years. Management officials would generally remain prohibited from serving with multiple depository organizations that are above the new thresholds, limiting the potential risk of anticompetitive conduct at larger institutions. The agencies also invite public comment on other proposed approaches to raising the current thresholds. The proposal responds to comments received during the recent review required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. It was jointly issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181220a.htm,Agencies release annual CRA asset-size threshold adjustments for small and intermediate small institutions,,2018.0,"WASHINGTON--The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced the annual adjustment to the asset-size thresholds used to define small bank, small savings association, intermediate small bank, and intermediate small savings association under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations. The annual adjustments are required by the CRA rules. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. Those meeting the small and intermediate small institution asset-size thresholds are not subject to the reporting requirements applicable to large banks and savings associations unless they choose to be evaluated as a large institution. Annual adjustments to these asset-size thresholds are based on the change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million. As a result of the 2.59 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2018, the definitions of small and intermediate small institutions for CRA examinations will change as follows:  ""Small bank"" or ""small savings association"" means an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.284 billion. ""Intermediate small bank"" or ""intermediate small savings association"" means a small institution with assets of at least $321 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.284 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.  These asset-size threshold adjustments will be effective as stated in the final rule that will be published in the Federal Register. In addition, the agencies will post a list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds on the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (https://www.ffiec.gov/cra).

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181220c.htm,Federal Reserve and FDIC announce resolution plan determinations for four foreign-based banks and finalize guidance for eight domestic banks,,2018.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Thursday announced that the resolution plans of four foreign-based banks had weaknesses, but did not have ""deficiencies,"" which are weaknesses severe enough to result in additional prudential requirements if not corrected. The agencies determined that the plans of the four firms--Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and UBS--have ""shortcomings,"" which are less severe weaknesses that require additional work in their next plan. These shortcomings in the four firms' plans include weaknesses in how each firm communicates and coordinates between its U.S. operations and its foreign parent in stress. Credit Suisse also had a shortcoming related to estimating the liquidity needs of its U.S. intermediate holding company in a resolution. Resolution plans, required by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as living wills, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. For foreign banking organizations, resolution plans are focused on their U.S. operations; however, the agencies acknowledge that the preferred outcome for these four foreign-based banks is a successful home country resolution using a single point of entry resolution strategy. The agencies sent feedback letters to each firm detailing the shortcomings and specific actions that can be taken to address them. The firms must address the shortcomings in their next resolution plans, which are due July 1, 2020, and are expected to implement certain resolution projects in the interim. Since the 2007 financial crisis, the four firms have improved their resolvability by significantly reducing the size and risk profiles of their U.S. operations and increasing their capital and liquidity levels. At the same time, the resolvability of firms will change as both the firms and markets continue to evolve. The agencies expect the firms to remain vigilant in assessing their resolvability. Also on Thursday, the agencies announced that they have finalized resolution plan guidance applying to the eight largest and most complex domestic banking organizations. The final guidance is largely similar to the proposal issued in June 2018, and provides additional information for the firms regarding their resolution planning capabilities in areas such as capital, liquidity, and payment, clearing, and settlement activities. While the capital and liquidity sections of the final guidance remain largely unchanged from the proposed guidance and the guidance from 2016, the agencies intend to provide additional information on resolution liquidity and internal loss absorbing capacity in the future.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20181220a.htm,Federal Reserve Payments Study Supplement shows accelerated electronic payments growth,,2018.0,"Growth in card payments has accelerated, according to new electronic payments data collected by the Federal Reserve. Card payments increased 10.1 percent by number and 8.4 percent by value from 2016 to 2017, each larger than the increases of 7.8 percent by number and 6.3 percent by value from 2015 to 2016. Remote payments claimed a greater share of total general-purpose card transactions over the 2016 to 2017 period, and the number of in-person chip-authenticated card payments also posted substantial gains. Check payments and automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals declined by number yet increased in value. The annual supplementary data, which were collected between the triennial Federal Reserve Payments Studies (FRPS), show that the sum of credit card, non-prepaid debit card, and prepaid debit card payments increased 11.3 billion from 112.2 billion to 123.5 billion payments by number and increased $500 billion from $6 trillion to $6.5 trillion by value from 2016 to 2017. The increase in the number of card payments in 2017 was boosted by continued strong growth in the number of card payments made remotely, including for shopping and bill paying. The number of in-person chip-authenticated card payments also recorded a noteworthy gain in 2017, increasing to 41.6 percent of all in-person general-purpose card payments. For the first time, chip-authenticated payments captured more than half of the value of in-person general-purpose card payments. Key findings of the study include:  Card payments continued to show robust growth from 2016 to 2017. At 10 percent, credit cards had the highest growth rate by value. Debit card payments, which made up 66.9 percent of card payments in 2017 by number, grew by 6.5 percent including 7.0 percent of increase in non-prepaid card payments and 3 percent of increase in prepaid debit card payments. In a departure from previous reporting periods, a surge was seen in the number of prepaid and non-prepaid debit card payments relative to credit card payments. Remote general-purpose card payments increased 22.8 percent by number from 2016 to 2017, compared with in-person payments, which grew just 7.2 percent. Over the same period, the value of remote payments increased 14.8 percent, compared with in-person payments, which increased by just 4.4 percent. Network automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments grew faster, with network ACH payments increasing 5.7 percent by number and 6.9 percent by value from 2016 to 2017. The growth for network ACH payments was 5.3 percent by number and 5.1 percent by value from 2015 to 2016. Check payments, based on a survey of the largest U.S. depository and financial institutions, showed a faster decline of 4.8 percent by number from 2016 to 2017 compared to a decline of 3.6 percent from 2015 to 2016. The value of check payments increased 7.5 percent from 2016 to 2017 after decreasing 3.7 percent from 2015 to 2016. ATM withdrawals, based on a survey of the largest U.S. depository and financial institutions, have declined by number and increased by value in all study periods from 2012 through 2017. From 2016 to 2017, ATM withdrawals fell 2.8 percent by number and rose 0.5 percent by value.

The Volcker Rule generally restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds. The agencies are jointly proposing to exclude community banks with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. Additionally, consistent with EGRRCPA, the proposal would, under certain circumstances, permit a hedge fund or private equity fund to share the same name or a variation of the same name with an investment adviser that is not an insured depository institution, company that controls an insured depository institution, or bank holding company.

The payments include two lump-sum payments totaling approximately $3.2 billion, necessary to reduce aggregate Reserve Bank capital surplus to $6.825 billion as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Budget Act) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Economic Growth Act). The 2018 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in March and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results. The Federal Reserve Banks' 2018 estimated net income of $63.1 billion represents a decrease of $17.6 billion from 2017, primarily attributable to an increase of $12.6 billion in interest expense associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions. Net income for 2018 was derived primarily from $112.3 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations--U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, and GSE debt securities. The Federal Reserve Banks had interest expense of $38.5 billion primarily associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions, and incurred interest expense of $4.6 billion on securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Operating expenses of the Reserve Banks, net of amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury and other entities for services the Reserve Banks provided as fiscal agents, totaled $4.3 billion in 2018. In addition, the Reserve Banks were assessed $849 million for the costs related to producing, issuing, and retiring currency, $838 million for Board expenditures, and $337 million to fund the operations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additional earnings were derived from income from services of $444 million. Statutory dividends totaled $1 billion in 2018.

While the effects of the federal government shutdown on individuals should be temporary, affected borrowers may face a temporary hardship in making payments on debts such as mortgages, student loans, car loans, business loans, or credit cards. As they have in prior shutdowns, the agencies encourage financial institutions to consider prudent efforts to modify terms on existing loans or extend new credit to help affected borrowers. Prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe-and-sound lending practices are generally in the long-term best interest of the financial institution, the borrower, and the economy. Such efforts should not be subject to examiner criticism. Consumers affected by the government shutdown are encouraged to contact their lenders immediately should they encounter financial strain.

The index has kept pace with an ever-evolving industrial sector by providing information that spans from the rise of the modern factory through the digital age. The Board began collecting information about industrial production to satisfy the Federal Reserve's need for timely and relevant data on the U.S. economy. The Board's measure of industrial production remains an important economic indicator today and is frequently used by academics, businesses, and policymakers. The index originally divided output into 55 categories and now includes 300, reflecting an increased ability to track the diversity and changing composition of the industrial sector. For example, in 1919, textile manufacturing represented nearly a quarter of the index. Almost the same proportion is represented in 2019 by the combination of motor vehicles and parts, aircraft, and oil and gas extraction. Textiles now represent less than 1 percent of the index.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190125a.htm,"Shared National Credit review finds some improvement in credit quality, risk remains elevated in leveraged loans",,2019.0,"Federal banking agencies find that risk in the portfolio of large syndicated bank loans has declined, due to improving conditions in most sectors. Despite the improvement, the dollar volume of loans rated below ""pass,"" as a percentage of total loans, remains elevated compared with levels experienced in prior economic cycles, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program Review. The report--released today by the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)--reflects the results of reviews in 2018 covering SNC loans originated by or before March 31, 2018. Furthermore, the review finds increased risks associated with leveraged lending. The agencies remind banks to update credit risk management practices as the risk profile of borrowers and the industry changes. The 2018 SNC portfolio included 8,571 credit facilities to 5,314 borrowers, totaling $4.4 trillion, up from $4.3 trillion in 2017. U.S. banks held the greatest volume of SNC commitments at 44.3 percent of the portfolio, followed by foreign banking organizations and other investor entities such as securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds. Effective January 1, 2018, the agencies increased the minimum aggregate loan commitment threshold to be included in the review from $20 million to $100 million. Under the revised definition, loan commitments increased modestly compared with levels reported in 2017. The number of borrowers and credit facilities, however, has declined. Reviewed loan commitments were stratified by the severity of their risk--special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss, the last three of which are known as ""classified."" Overall, the level of loans rated below ""pass,"" as a percentage of the total SNC portfolio, decreased year-over-year from 9.7 percent to 6.7 percent. Leveraged lending was the primary contributor to the overall ""special mention"" and ""classified"" rates, comprising 73 percent of ""special mention"" and 86 percent of ""classified"" commitments. Investors outside the banking industry held the greatest volume of ""special mention"" and ""classified"" commitments, followed by U.S. banks and foreign banking organizations. The agencies conduct SNC reviews in the first and third calendar quarters with some banks receiving two reviews and others receiving a single review each year. The agencies issue a single statement annually that includes combined findings from the previous 12 months. This practice presents a complete view of the entire SNC portfolio, which can be compared with prior years' reports.

Additionally, the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program. Accordingly, all participants agreed to the following:   The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.   The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.

Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.

The changes are intended to improve public understanding of the program while maintaining its ability to independently test large banks' resilience. The first change, which will begin for the 2019 stress test cycle and expand in subsequent years, will provide significantly more information about the stress testing models used in the Board's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). That information will include:  Ranges of loss rates, estimated using the Board's models, for actual loans held by CCAR firms; Portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by the Board's models; and More detailed descriptions of the Board's models, such as certain equations and key variables that influence the results of the models.  Using this additional information, a firm would be better able to evaluate the risks in its own portfolio or compare the losses from its own models to losses from the Board's models. In response to comments received on the proposal from December 2017, the Board will provide additional information on a number of models, including those used to project operational-risk losses and pre-provision net revenue. The model disclosure will be updated each year and published in the first quarter of the year. In addition, the Board finalized a stress testing policy statement, which elaborates on prior disclosures by describing the Board's approach to model development, implementation, and validation. The statement describes seven principles that have guided supervisory stress test modeling in the past and will continue to do so. The Board also modified its framework for the design of the annual hypothetical economic scenarios. The modifications will provide more information on the hypothetical path of the unemployment rate and will introduce a quantitative guide for the hypothetical path of house prices, both of which are key variables for the scenarios. In a change from its proposal, the Board will not add variables to the hypothetical stress test scenario related to funding costs.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190205b.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases scenarios for 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act stress test exercises,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday released the scenarios banks and supervisors will use for the 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act stress test exercises. Stress tests, by ensuring that banks have adequate capital to absorb losses, help make sure that they will be able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. CCAR evaluates the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, and large U.S. operations of foreign firms, using their planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and share buybacks and issuances. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests also help ensure that banks can continue to lend during times of stress, but use standard capital distribution assumptions for all firms. Both assessments only apply to domestic bank holding companies and foreign bank intermediate holding companies with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The stress tests run by the firms and the Board apply three hypothetical scenarios: baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. For the 2019 cycle, the severely adverse scenario features a severe global recession in which the U.S. unemployment rate rises by more than 6 percentage points to 10 percent. In keeping with the Board's public framework for scenario design, a stronger economy with a lower starting point for the unemployment rate results in a tougher scenario. The severely adverse scenario also includes elevated stress in corporate loan and commercial real estate markets. ""The hypothetical scenario features the largest unemployment rate change to date,"" Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. ""We are confident this scenario will effectively test the resiliency of the nation's largest banks."" The adverse scenario features a moderate recession in the United States, as well as weakening economic activity across all countries included in the scenario. The adverse and severely adverse scenarios describe hypothetical sets of events designed to assess the strength of banking organizations and their resilience. They are not forecasts. The baseline scenario is in line with average projections from surveys of economic forecasters. It does not represent the forecast of the Federal Reserve. Each scenario includes 28 variables--such as gross domestic product, the unemployment rate, stock market prices, and interest rates--covering domestic and international economic activity. Along with the variables, the Board is publishing a narrative description of the scenarios that also highlights changes from last year. Firms with large trading operations will be required to factor in a global market shock component as part of their scenarios. Additionally, firms with substantial trading or processing operations will be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario component. Banks are required to submit their capital plans and the results of their own stress tests to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2019. The Federal Reserve will announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30, 2019. The instructions for this year's CCAR will be released at a later date. Also on Tuesday, the Board announced that it will be providing relief to less-complex firms from stress testing requirements and CCAR by effectively moving the firms to an extended stress test cycle for this year. The relief applies to firms generally with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. As a result, these less-complex firms will not be subject to a supervisory stress test during the 2019 cycle and their capital distributions for this year will be largely based on the results from the 2018 supervisory stress test. At a later date, the Board will propose for notice and comment a final capital distribution method for firms on an extended stress test cycle in future years.

The survey has been undertaken every three years since 1983. It is being conducted for the Board by NORC, a social science research organization at the University of Chicago, through December of this year. The data collected will provide a representative picture of what Americans own (from houses and cars to stocks and bonds), how and how much they borrow, and how they bank. Past study results have contributed to policy discussions about the recovery of households from the Great Recession, changes in the use of credit, the use of tax-preferred retirement savings accounts, and a broad range of other issues. ""This survey is one of the nation's primary sources of information on the financial condition of different types of families,"" Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell said in a letter to prospective survey participants. ""Our previous surveysâ¦have helped the Federal Reserve and other parts of the government make policy decisions and have also supported a wide variety of basic research, public discussion, and education."" Participants in the study are chosen at random from 128 areas, including metropolitan areas and rural counties across the United States, using a scientific sampling procedure. A representative of NORC contacts each potential participant personally to explain the study and request time for an interview. ""I assure you that we give the highest priority to guarding the privacy of all survey participants and the confidentiality of their answers,"" Chairman Powell said. NORC uses names and addresses only for the administration of the survey, and that identifying information will be destroyed at the close of the study. NORC is forbidden from giving the names and addresses of participants to anyone at the Federal Reserve or anywhere else. Summary results for the 2019 study will be published in late 2020 after all data from the survey have been assessed and analyzed. The attached letter from Chairman Powell will be mailed in mid-March to approximately 13,000 households urging their participation in the study.

In making this determination, the Board followed the framework detailed in the Board's policy statement for setting the CCyB for private-sector credit exposures located in the United States. The buffer is a macroprudential tool that can be used to increase the resilience of the financial system by raising capital requirements on internationally active banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal future losses and when the banking organizations for which capital requirements would be raised by the buffer are exposed to or are contributing to this elevated risk--either directly or indirectly. The buffer could also help moderate fluctuations in the supply of credit. The CCyB is designed to be released when economic conditions deteriorate, in order to support lending and economic activity more broadly. The Board consulted with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in making this determination. Should the Board decide to modify the CCyB amount in the future, banking organizations would have 12 months before the increase became effective, unless the Board establishes an earlier effective date.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190306b.htm,"Federal Reserve Board announces it will limit the use of the ""qualitative objection"" in its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, effective for the 2019 cycle",,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced that it will limit the use of the ""qualitative objection"" in its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, effective for the 2019 cycle. The changes eliminate the qualitative objection for most firms due to the improvements in capital planning made by the largest firms. For the largest and most complex firms, CCAR includes both a quantitative evaluation of a firm's capital adequacy under stress and a qualitative evaluation of its abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. As applicable, a firm must pass both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation or the Board may object and restrict the firm's shareholder distributions. Firms that are newer to the CCAR exercise and as a result may have capital planning capabilities that are less established will remain subject to a possible objection on qualitative grounds. Specifically, a firm must participate in four CCAR exercises and successfully pass the qualitative evaluation in the fourth year to no longer be subject to a potential qualitative objection. If a firm does not pass in its fourth year, it will continue to be subject to a possible qualitative objection until it passes. For firms still subject to the qualitative objection, their fourth year will generally be the 2020 CCAR cycle. While the qualitative objection will no longer apply to certain firms, all firms will continue to be subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning processes as part of CCAR. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. In addition, all firms remain subject to a potential objection on quantitative grounds. The Board on Wednesday also released the instructions for this year's CCAR exercise. The instructions confirm that 18 firms will be subject to this year's CCAR exercise, with five of those firms subject to a possible qualitative objection. Eleven firms with large trading operations will be required to factor in a global market shock as part of their scenarios. Thirteen firms with substantial trading or processing operations will also be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario.

Recent reports have also revealed dynamic changes in aggregate payments fraud, automated teller machine withdrawals, and payment authentication methods, among other topics. ""The U.S. payments system has changed dramatically since 2000, and the Federal Reserve Payments Study has served as an aggregate benchmark for the payments industry, policymakers, and the public,"" said Mary Kepler, senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the study's executive sponsor. ""Robust industry support and respondents' willingness to participate is paramount to our ability to publish timely, accurate, and high quality results."" The 2019 Federal Reserve Payments Study will administer two surveys, each contributing valuable information required to obtain robust estimates of totals and developing trends in the number and value of payments made with checks, cards, electronic transfers, and various alternative payment initiation methods and systems for calendar year 2018:  A survey of the commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions that process the majority of payments in this country. A survey of payment card networks, third-party payment processors, issuers of private-label cards, and providers of various alternative payment initiation methods and systems.

This action applies to legacy swaps that were entered into before applicable regulatory margin requirements took effect and is generally consistent with similar relief contemplated by international jurisdictions.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190318a.htm,Federal Reserve announces members of Fraud Definitions Work Group,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve today announced the members of its Fraud Definitions Work Group, the latest initiative to advance the Federal Reserve's strategy for improving the U.S. payment system. Over the next year, these 22 payments industry leaders and subject matter specialists will work collaboratively with Federal Reserve leaders to formulate recommendations for improving the quality and consistency of automated clearing house (ACH), wire, and check fraud data. Although noncash payments fraud remains a very small fraction of total payments value, it is a large number in absolute terms--approximately $8.3 billion in 2015. This, combined with the growth of real-time payments, underscores the need to better understand payment confidentiality, integrity, and security threats. ""The Fraud Definitions Work Group is another step in the Federal Reserve's efforts to promote the safety, security, and integrity of the U.S. payment system through collaboration with the payments industry,"" said David Sapenaro, Federal Reserve System payments strategy director and chief operating officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ""Understanding payments fraud trends can help us mitigate fraud risk,"" said Ken Montgomery, Federal Reserve System payments security strategy leader and chief operating officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""However, there often are inconsistencies in the classification and reporting of payments fraud data from study to study and a significant lag between the time that fraud occurs and when it's reported. In addition, fraudsters continually adapt their attacks as the use of ACH, wire, and checks for innovative faster payments evolves."" In January, the Federal Reserve outlined the expertise needed to serve on the work group and asked payments experts to submit ""expressions of interest."" The Federal Reserve selected work group participants from these submissions and appointed some additional Federal Reserve and industry participants to ensure diversity of thought and strong expertise across the many needed disciplines. The Fraud Definitions Work Group seeks to build a recommended payments fraud classification model that includes detailed definitions and/or categories to help the industry better understand key data points and address ACH, wire, and check payments fraud. Work will begin later this month to examine existing payments fraud definitions and areas where new or changed definitions could be helpful. The work group also will create a roadmap to encourage broad industry adoption of this classification model to improve the consistency and timeliness of available payments fraud data.

Clarida on the passing of Alan Krueger,,2019.0,"I'm deeply saddened by the death of Alan Krueger of Princeton University, whom I have known since graduate school more than 30 years ago. As an economist, he inspired his colleagues by combining a zeal for academic rigor with a passion for public service. Alan made a difference and inspired everyone who learned from his research or benefited from the policies he developed. His untimely passing represents an enormous loss to our profession.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H. Powell, Chairman; John C. Williams, Vice Chairman; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L. Evans; Esther L. George; Randal K. Quarles; and Eric S. Rosengren. Implementation Note issued March 20, 2019",20190320,349
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm,Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans,,2019.0,"In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings and the level of reserves in the banking system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the Committee to provide additional information regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime. At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. The Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization released in January as well as the principles and plans listed below together revise and replace the Committee's earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  To ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation, the Committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over coming quarters provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve about as expected. 	 The Committee intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of Treasury securities by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of $30 billion to $15 billion beginning in May 2019. The Committee intends to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of September 2019. The Committee intends to continue to allow its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. 		 Beginning in October 2019, principal payments received from agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any principal payments in excess of that maximum will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS. Principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS below the $20 billion maximum will initially be invested in Treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; the Committee will revisit this reinvestment plan in connection with its deliberations regarding the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio. It continues to be the Committee's view that limited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings. The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance.   The average level of reserves after the FOMC has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of September will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy. 		 In that case, the Committee currently anticipates that it will likely hold the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time. During such a period, persistent gradual increases in currency and other non-reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.   When the Committee judges that reserve balances have declined to this level, the SOMA portfolio will hold no more securities than necessary for efficient and effective policy implementation. Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system.",20190320,605

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190321a.htm,Federal Reserve Board publishes report containing summary information on debit card transactions in 2017,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday published a report on debit card transactions in 2017, including information on volume and value, interchange fee revenue, certain issuer costs, and fraud losses. The report is the fifth in a series published every two years pursuant to section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). Section 920 also imposes limits on interchange fees that debit card issuers can receive on an electronic debit transaction. The Board's Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing), which implements section 920, provides that a debit card issuer subject to the interchange fee standard (a covered issuer) may not receive an interchange fee that exceeds 21 cents plus 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, plus a 1-cent fraud-prevention adjustment, if eligible. The regulation does not apply to debit card issuers with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, certain government-administered debit cards, and certain prepaid cards. The interchange fee standard became effective on October 1, 2011. As in prior years, covered issuers' costs of authorizing, clearing, and settling (ACS) debit card transactions, excluding issuer fraud losses, varied greatly across respondents in 2017, with the issuer at the 25th percentile having an average ACS cost of 4.2 cents and the issuer at the 75th percentile having an average ACS cost of 18.5 cents. Issuers with the highest debit card transaction volume generally had the lowest ACS costs per transaction. The average ACS cost per transaction for covered issuers was 3.6 cents per transaction, down from 4.2 cents per transaction in 2015. Debit-card fraud losses to all parties (merchants, cardholders, and issuers) were 11.2 basis points as a share of transaction value at covered issuers in 2017, up from 10.3 in 2015. The median covered issuer's average fraud loss as a share of transaction value was 5.3 basis points, down from 6.6 in 2015. The median covered issuer had average fraud prevention and data security costs of 1.5 cents per transaction, down from 1.7 cents in 2015. In 2017, 76 percent of covered issuers had average ACS costs, including issuer fraud losses, below 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the value of a transaction (the base component of the interchange fee standard). This proportion is higher than the 65 percent of covered issuers with average ACS costs below the maximum interchange fee in 2015. Covered issuers with average ACS costs below the maximum interchange fee in 2017 processed 99.7 percent of all reported covered transactions, up from 99.5 percent in 2015.

An independent public accounting firm engaged by the Board has issued unqualified opinions on the financial statements and on the Board's and the Bank's internal controls over financial reporting. The audited financial statements provide information about the assets, liabilities, and earnings of the Reserve Banks and the Board as of December 31, 2018. The Federal Reserve Banks' 2018 earnings were approximately $63.1 billion, representing a decrease of $17.6 billion from 2017. The Reserve Banks provided for remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $65.3 billion in 2018, including two lump-sum payments totaling approximately $3.2 billion that were necessary to reduce the aggregate Reserve Bank capital surplus to $6.8 billion as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Interest income on securities acquired through open market operations totaled $112.3 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the previous year. Interest expense on depository institutions' reserve balances during the year was $38.5 billion, an increase of $12.6 billion from the previous year. Interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase was $4.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from the previous year. Reserve Bank operating expenses were $7.0 billion, including assessments of $2.0 billion for Board expenses, currency costs, and the operations of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Total Reserve Bank assets as of December 31, 2018, were approximately $4.1 trillion, a decrease of $392.1 billion from the previous year. Total Reserve Bank assets were composed primarily of $4.0 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities acquired through open market operations. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York provides additional detailed information about open market operations and securities holdings on an ongoing basis on its website at www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pomo_landing.html. During 2018, all remaining securities held by Maiden Lane LLC, a variable interest entity created to support the Federal Reserve's response to the 2008 financial crisis, were sold. The net proceeds were distributed to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and on November 1, 2018, Maiden Lane was dissolved. The Board engages KPMG LLP, an independent public accounting firm, to conduct annual audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and, for the Board of Governors audit only, the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190325a.htm,Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions affected by flooding in the Midwest,,2019.0,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the state regulators, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of flooding in the Midwest on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disasters. Lending: Financial institutions should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by flooding in the Midwest. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings. This evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, which requires judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructurings. In supervising institutions affected by flooding in the Midwest, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the flooding in the Midwest. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by flooding in the Midwest. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by flooding in the Midwest may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by flooding in the Midwest that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the effects of flooding in the Midwest. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by flooding in the Midwest. Institutions should monitor municipal securities and loans affected by flooding in the Midwest. Appropriate monitoring and prudent efforts to stabilize such investments are encouraged.

The release of the document follows an announcement in February that the Board had finalized changes intended to increase the transparency of its stress tests without compromising their ability to test the resiliency of the nation's largest banks. Stress tests ensure that banks have adequate capital to absorb losses and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are one component of the Federal Reserve's stress testing program along with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which evaluates the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of the largest bank holding companies. The document is intended to improve public understanding of the Federal Reserve's stress tests. Today's document, with roughly 80 pages and more than 30 tables, provides significantly more information on the stress test models that are used to project bank losses, compared to disclosures from past years. The additional information consists of:  Ranges of loss rates, projected using the Federal Reserve's models, for loans that are grouped by distinct risk characteristics; Portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates projected by the Federal Reserve's models; and Enhanced descriptions of the Federal Reserve's models.  In particular, the additional information on loss rates is provided for the models used for corporate loans and credit cards. These two models accounted for roughly half of total projected loan losses in the Federal Reserve's 2018 stress test. Similar information will be provided in 2020 for two additional models.

Resolution plans, required by the Dodd-Frank Act and commonly known as living wills, must describe a firm's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the firm. The 14 firms evaluated were: Ally Financial Inc., American Express Company, BB&T Corporation, Capital One Financial Corporation, Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, KeyCorp, M&T Bank Corporation, Northern Trust Corporation, Regions Financial Corporation, SunTrust Banks, Inc., The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and U.S. Bancorp. The agencies did not identify any deficiencies or shortcomings in the 2017 resolution plans, which are weaknesses that the firms are required to address. The agencies previously identified three shortcomings in Northern Trust's 2015 resolution plan, and decided that Northern Trust's 2017 resolution plan satisfactorily addressed these three shortcomings. The Board is releasing the feedback letter for each firm. These letters note that the agencies intend to issue for notice and comment proposed revisions to the resolution plan rule, including changes to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The letters also outline the expectations under the current rule requirements and explain that, in most cases, the agencies generally expect each firm's 2019 submission to include only material changes from its previous plan and updated financial statements.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190402a.htm,Agencies propose rule to limit impact of large bank failures,,2019.0,"The federal banking agencies on Tuesday proposed a rule to limit the interconnectedness of large banking organizations and reduce the impact from failure of the largest banking organizations. The proposal would complement other measures that the banking agencies have taken to limit interconnectedness among large banking organizations. Global systemically important bank holding companies, or GSIBs, are the largest and most complex banking organizations and are required to issue debt with certain features under the Board's ""total loss-absorbing capacity,"" or TLAC, rule. That debt would be used to recapitalize the holding company during bankruptcy or resolution if it were to fail. To discourage GSIBs and ""advanced approaches"" banking organizations--generally, firms that have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure--from purchasing large amounts of TLAC debt, the proposal would require such banking organizations to hold additional capital against substantial holdings of TLAC debt. This would reduce interconnectedness between large banking organizations and, if a GSIB were to fail, reduce the impact on the financial system from that failure. The proposal from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would also require the holding companies of GSIBs to report publicly their TLAC debt outstanding.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190403a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces changes to its Payment System Risk Policy regarding intraday credit to U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday published a final rule implementing policy changes to procedures governing the provision of intraday credit to U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations (FBOs). The changes are intended to refine the methods for determining the level of intraday credit that these branches and agencies can receive from the Federal Reserve Banks. Part II of the Board's Payment System Risk Policy (PSR policy) governs the provision of intraday credit (or daylight overdrafts) in accounts at the Reserve Banks. The PSR policy recognizes that the Federal Reserve has an important role in providing intraday balances and credit to foster the smooth functioning of the overall payment system and also seeks to control the risks assumed by the Reserve Banks in providing this intraday credit, which is made available to meet temporary needs at healthy depository institutions. Although the PSR policy's intraday credit provisions generally apply similarly to FBOs and U.S. institutions, certain procedures for determining the level of intraday credit that FBOs can receive from the Federal Reserve Banks differ. Where the procedures are different for FBOs, the PSR policy relies on an FBO's strength of support assessment (SOSA) ranking and its status as a financial holding company (FHC) to determine the level of intraday credit that U.S. branches and agencies of the FBO can receive from the Federal Reserve Banks. The Board has announced that the SOSA ranking will be eliminated; additionally, the Board believes that an FBO's status as an FHC should not affect the FBO's access to intraday credit. With this rulemaking, the Board is removing references to SOSA and an FBO's FHC status while adopting alternative methods for determining FBOs' eligibility for positive net debit cap, the size of the net debit cap, and its eligibility to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity. The Board believes that FBOs' resulting net debit caps will be better tailored to FBOs' use of intraday credit and will not constrain FBOs' U.S. operations.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190408a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on regulatory framework that would more closely match rules for foreign banks with the risks they pose to U.S. financial system,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday invited public comment on a regulatory framework that would more closely match the rules for foreign banks with the risks they pose to the U.S. financial system. The changes would maintain the most stringent requirements for firms with the most risk, while reducing compliance requirements for firms with less risk. Under the proposed framework, foreign banks with $100 billion or more in U.S. assets would be sorted into categories of increasingly stringent requirements based on several factors. The factors, which reflect banks' complexity and risk to the financial system, include asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. ""This proposal maintains the substantial resilience built up across the U.S. financial system over the past decade, while at the same time making appropriate adjustments for firms that present less risk,"" Chair Jerome H. Powell said. The framework is substantially the same as the framework proposed last year by the Board for large domestic banks, with some adjustments reflecting structural differences in foreign banks' U.S. operations. The proposal also builds on the Board's existing tailoring of its rules. ""The proposal seeks to increase the efficiency of the firms without compromising the strong resiliency of the financial sector,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. While the framework is substantively the same for both domestic and foreign banks, the resulting impact may be different. For example, currently, foreign banks operating in the United States tend to rely on less stable short-term wholesale funding and can be complex, which present heightened risks. If a bank is engaged in these higher-risk activities, the framework would result in more stringent regulations. The Board estimates that the framework would, at this time, increase required liquid assets by 0.5 to 4 percent and decrease required capital by roughly 0.5 percent for foreign banks with $100 billion or more in U.S. assets. The proposal also requests comment on whether the Board should apply new liquidity requirements to the branches of foreign banks. The branches of foreign banks are currently subject to internal liquidity stress tests, but are not subject to standardized liquidity requirements. The proposal asks for comment on whether such standardized liquidity requirements should be imposed and on several different approaches for doing so. The proposals were jointly developed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Charts are provided that show the proposed requirements for each category, as well as a list of firms projected to be included in each category. Comments will be accepted through June 21, 2019.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190416a.htm,Agencies invite comment on modifications to resolution plan requirements; proposal keeps existing requirements for largest firms and reduces requirements for firms with less risk,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Tuesday invited public comment on a proposal modifying their resolution plan requirements for large banking firms. The proposal would keep existing resolution plan expectations in place for the largest firms, while reducing requirements for smaller firms that pose less risk. Resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a firm's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the firm. Since the resolution planning requirements took effect in 2012, large firms have improved their resolution strategies and governance, refined their estimates of liquidity and capital needs in resolution, and simplified their legal structures. These changes have made the firms substantially more resilient. The proposal, which builds on a separate framework proposed by the banking agencies, establishes a graduated set of resolution planning requirements that depend on the level of risk a firm poses for the financial system. The proposal is consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and would affect domestic and foreign banks with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. For the most systemically important firms, the proposal would adopt the current practice of requiring resolution plans to be submitted on a two-year cycle. The proposal would tailor the rule's requirements for firms that do not pose the same systemic risk as the largest institutions, requiring these plans to be submitted on a three-year cycle. Both groups of firms would alternate between submitting full plans and targeted plans. Foreign banks with the smallest or least complex U.S. operations would be required to submit reduced content plans, commensurate with their reduced operations. A targeted resolution plan would include core elements like capital and liquidity, material changes to the firm, as well as areas of interest identified by the agencies. Generally, reduced content plans would include only material changes since the prior plan submission. All plans would continue to include a publicly available section. For the smallest and least complex domestic firms that engage in traditional banking activities and present the least risk, the proposal would eliminate resolution planning requirements. However, if one of those firms engages in risky activity above a certain threshold, it would be required to submit a resolution plan. The attached charts show the proposed requirements and a list of firms in each category. The agencies are requesting comment by June 21.

The EGRRCPA requires the agencies to permit certain firms--those predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activities--to exclude qualifying deposits at central banks from their supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio applies only to certain large or internationally active banking organizations. Based on data available at the time of the proposal, only The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Northern Trust Corporation, and State Street Corporation, together with their depository institution subsidiaries, would be considered predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activities and therefore able to exclude deposits at central banks from their supplementary leverage ratio.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190423a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on proposal to simplify and increase the transparency of rules for determining control of a banking organization,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday invited public comment on a proposal that would simplify and increase the transparency of the Board's rules for determining control of a banking organization. If a company has control over a banking organization, the company generally becomes subject to the Board's rules and regulations. Over time, the Board has issued public and private interpretations on the topic of control, but banking organizations and their investors often remain uncertain about whether a proposed investment is controlling. The proposal would set forth a comprehensive regulatory framework for control determinations and request comment on the framework. ""Providing all stakeholders with clearer rules of the road for control determinations will responsibly reduce regulatory burden,"" Chair Jerome H. Powell said. ""As a result, it will be easier for banks, particularly community banks, to raise capital to support lending and investment."" In particular, the proposal lays out several factors and thresholds that the Board will use to determine if a company has control over a bank. The key factors include the company's total voting and non-voting equity investment in the bank; director, officer, and employee overlaps between the company and the bank; and the scope of business relationships between the company and the bank. The proposal clearly describes what combination of those factors would and would not trigger control. As a result, the proposal would reduce complexity and burden for banking organizations and their investors, and provide clarity so that a wide range of stakeholders can better understand the control rules. ""The Board's control framework has developed over time through a Delphic and hermetic process that has generally not benefited from public comment,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. ""This proposal would place substantially all of the Board's control positions into a comprehensive public regulatory proposal and allow public comment on those positions to improve their content and consistency."" The attached chart shows how different combinations of the factors would or would not result in control. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190501a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Growth of household spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190503a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites comment on a proposal to apply netting protections to a broader range of financial institutions,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday requested comment on a proposal to reduce risk and increase efficiency in the financial system by applying netting protections to a broader range of financial institutions. The proposal would amend Regulation EE (Financial Institution Netting) to apply netting provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) to certain new entities including swap dealers. The proposal would also make minor clarifications to the existing activities-based test in Regulation EE to clarify how the activities-based test applies following a consolidation of legal entities. Sections 401-407 of FDICIA validate netting contracts among financial institutions. Parties to a netting contract agree that they will pay or receive the net, rather than the gross, payment due under the netting contract. FDICIA provides certainty that netting contracts will be enforced, even in the event of the insolvency of one of the parties. Regulation EE currently includes an activities-based test pursuant to which an entity can qualify as a financial institution for purposes of FDICIA's netting provisions if it is a market intermediary and, during the previous 15-month period, it engaged in financial contracts exceeding specified numerical thresholds. Consistent with FDICIA's goals of reducing systemic risk and increasing efficiency in the financial markets, the Board proposes to expand the definition of financial institution to ensure that certain entities qualify as financial institutions, including swap dealers and security-based swap dealers; major swap participants and major security-based swap participants; nonbank systemically important financial institutions; certain financial market utilities; foreign banks; bridge institutions; and Federal Reserve Banks. The Board also proposes to clarify that, following a consolidation of legal entities, the surviving entity can determine whether its financial contracts exceeded the numerical thresholds in the activities-based test by considering the aggregated financial contracts of the consolidated persons during the previous 15-month period.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190509a.htm,Federal Reserve approves final rule to repeal regulations that incorporated the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday approved final amendments to its regulations to reflect the transfer of the Board's rulemaking authority for the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (S.A.F.E. Act) to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau). Entities that were subject to the Board's rules are now subject to the Bureau's rules. The S.A.F.E. Act mandates a nationwide licensing and registration system for residential mortgage loan originators. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act transferred rulemaking authority for the S.A.F.E. Act to the Bureau from the Board, the other federal banking agencies, and the Farm Credit Administration. Because the Bureau has already issued a final rule that is substantially identical to the Board's regulations that incorporate the S.A.F.E. Act, the Board is repealing the applicable provisions of Regulation H (Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System) and Regulation K (International Banking Operations). The Board's notice is attached. The amendments become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected shortly.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190509b.htm,Federal Reserve requests comment on potential modifications to operating  hours for the Reserve Banks' National Settlement Service and Fedwire Funds Service,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on potential modifications to the Federal Reserve Banks' National Settlement Service (NSS) and Fedwire® Funds Service to support enhancements to the same-day automated clearinghouse (ACH) service. The Board also requested comment on corresponding changes to the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk related to a new posting time for transactions and an increased daylight overdraft fee. On September 13, 2018, NACHA, the rules and standards body for the ACH network, announced that its voting members had approved amendments to the NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines to establish a third same-day ACH processing and settlement window. Currently, there is a morning window with a submission deadline of 10:30 a.m. ET and settlement at 1:00 p.m. ET and an afternoon window with a submission deadline of 2:45 p.m. ET and settlement at 5:00 p.m. ET. The new window, with a submission deadline of 4:45 p.m. ET and settlement at 6:00 p.m. ET, would allow originating depository financial institutions to submit same-day items later in the business day. A third same-day ACH window aligns with the Federal Reserve's ongoing objective to support improvements in the safety and efficiency of payment systems in the United States as well as public interest in greater availability of payment services. In particular, the later same-day ACH window would allow more institutions to use same-day ACH services during a greater portion of their business day and may promote greater adoption of same-day ACH and availability of the service to originators and end-users. The NACHA rules changes require adjustments to Federal Reserve services so that the private-sector ACH operator, The Clearing House, can settle same-day ACH transactions later in the day via the NSS. These changes include:  Extending the closing of NSS by one hour to 6:30 p.m. ET Extending the cutoff time for Reserve Bank accountholders to initiate transfers on behalf of third parties via the Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire Funds third-party cutoff) by 45 minutes to 6:45 p.m. ET Extending the closing of the Fedwire Funds Service by 30 minutes to 7:00 p.m. ET.  Collectively, these proposed changes are intended to allow sufficient time between the closing of NSS and the Fedwire Funds third-party cutoff, and between the Fedwire Funds third-party cutoff and the closing of the Fedwire Funds Service for depository institutions and their customers to reposition balances and manage liquidity. However, these potential modifications to NSS and the Fedwire Funds Service may increase certain risks and costs for Reserve Bank accountholders and their customers, including risks and costs related to compression of end-of-day processing activities, decreased availability of extensions to operating hours, and more frequent delays to the reopening of the Fedwire Funds Service. As such, the Federal Reserve has proposed options to manage any increased risks from the proposed operating hours. The Board requests comment on all aspects of these potential changes, including the Board's analysis of the potential public benefits and the potential options to mitigate the risk of more frequent delays to the reopening of the Fedwire Funds Service. The Board is not at this time directly addressing the comments received on the November 2018 notice regarding potential actions the Federal Reserve could take to support faster payments in the United States. Rather, the notice issued today is narrowly focused on whether the Reserve Banks should modify the operating hours for their wholesale services to support a third same-day ACH processing and settlement window. The Board continues to evaluate, and will separately respond to, comments on the November 2018 notice. A copy of the Board's Federal Register notice is attached.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190523b.htm,Federal Reserve Board issues Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households,,2019.0,"Accessible Keys for Video [Space Bar] toggles play/pause; [Right/Left Arrows] seeks the video forwards and back (5 sec ); [Up/Down Arrows] increase/decrease volume; [M] toggles mute on/off; [F] toggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11); The [Tab] key may be used in combination with the [Enter/Return] key to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.       The Federal Reserve Board's latest Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households found that most measures of economic well-being and financial resilience in 2018 were similar to, or slightly better than, those in 2017. Overall, the financial experiences reported by the 11,000 adults surveyed in 2018 were largely positive, and many families have experienced substantial gains since the survey began in 2013, in line with the nation's ongoing economic expansion. When asked about their overall economic well-being, 75 percent of U.S. adults said they were ""doing okay"" or ""living comfortably""âup 12 percentage points from 2013. The survey also asked how they would pay for a hypothetical unexpected expense of $400. Sixty-one percent said they would pay the expense with cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement; 27 percent would borrow or sell something; and 12 percent would not be able to cover it. In 2013, only half of adults said they would pay with cash or its equivalent. Despite the improved finances of many adults, the survey continued to detect areas of financial distress as well as persistent differences by race, education level, and, in some cases, geography. Nearly 8 in 10 whites reported doing at least okay financially, compared to two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics. A similar difference exists by education: among those with a bachelor's degree or higher, 87 percent were doing at least okay, compared with 64 percent of those with a high school degree or less. Of those who live in middle- and upper-income neighborhoods, 8 in 10 reported overall satisfaction with their community, compared to 6 in 10 of those living in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The report draws from the Board's sixth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which was conducted in October and November 2018 and examined the financial lives of U.S. adults and their families. Respondents described their experiences on a wide range of topics including income, employment, dealing with expenses, banking and credit, housing, education, and retirement. The responses were weighted to be nationally representative of adults, aged 18 and over, in the United States. A new topic in this year's reportâaimed at understanding the experiences of bank customersâwas the ability of adults to access funds in their bank accounts. Thirteen percent of those with a bank account had at least one problem accessing funds in their account in the prior year. Problems with a bank website or mobile app (7 percent) and delays in when funds were available to use (6 percent) were the most common problems cited. Those with volatile income and low savings were more likely to experience these problems. ""As this report shows, we continue to see the growing U.S. economy supporting most American families,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle W. Bowman. ""At the same time, the survey does find differences across communities, with just over half of those living in rural areas describing their local economy as good or excellent compared to two-thirds of those living in cities. Across the country, many families continue to experience financial distress and struggle to save for retirement and unexpected expenses."" The Board's SHED data look at how individuals are managing their finances and making decisions vital to their financial lives and futures. Among the report's other key findings:  Changes in family income from month to month remained a source of financial strain for some individuals. Three in 10 adults had family income that varied from month to month. One in 10 struggled to pay their bills at some point in the prior year because of monthly changes in income. Financial support from family or friends to make ends meet was also common, particularly among young adults. Most adults are working as much as they want to, an indicator of full employment; however, some remained unemployed or underemployed. One in 10 adults were not working and want to work, though many were not actively looking for work. Four percent of adults in the SHED were not working, wanted to work, and had applied for a job in the prior 12 months, similar to the official unemployment rate of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. Two in 10 were working but said they wanted to work more. Blacks, Hispanics, and those with less education are less likely to be satisfied with how much they were working. Two-thirds of graduates with a bachelor's degree or more believed that their educational investment had paid off financially, but only 3 in 10 of those who started but did not complete a degree shared this view. More than half of young adults who attended college took on some debt to pay for their education. Most borrowers were current on their payments or have successfully paid off their loans. More than one-fifth of borrowers who went to private for-profit schools were behind on their loan payments, versus 8 percent who attended public institutions and 5 percent who attended private not-for-profit institutions. Many adults were struggling to save for retirement. Thirty-six percent of non-retired respondents thought their retirement saving was on track, but one-quarter had no retirement savings or pension whatsoever. Even among those who had some savings, people commonly lacked financial knowledge and were uncomfortable making investment decisions.

The most recent survey was conducted in collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York between February 7, 2019, and February 21, 2019, and includes responses from banks that held roughly three quarters of total reserve balances at the time of the survey.

These ratios replace the prior year's ratios, which were released on June 15, 2018.  In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production.  Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio test that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state.  A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches.  A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate agency.  The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached.

The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are a forward-looking assessment of capital sufficiency using standard capital action assumptions for the largest domestic and foreign bank holding companies. CCAR evaluates the capital planning and capital adequacy of the same firms, but incorporates their planned capital actions, such as dividend payments and share buybacks and issuances. This year only the largest and most complex banksâgenerally those with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or moreâare subject to stress testing.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190619a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased. In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190621a.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases results of supervisory bank stress tests,,2019.0,"The nation's largest and most complex banks have strong capital levels that would allow them to stay well above their minimum requirements after being tested against a severe hypothetical recession, according to the results of supervisory stress tests released Friday by the Federal Reserve Board. The most severe hypothetical scenario projects $410 billion in total losses for the 18 participating bank holding companies. This scenario featured a global recession with the U.S. unemployment rate rising by more than 6 percentage points to 10 percent, accompanied by a large decline in real estate prices and elevated stress in corporate loan markets. The firms' aggregate common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets, would fall from an actual level of 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 to a minimum level of 9.2 percent. Since 2009, the common equity capital at the 18 firms has increased by more than $680 billion. ""The results confirm that our financial system remains resilient,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said. ""The nation's largest banks are significantly stronger than before the crisis and would be well-positioned to support the economy even after a severe shock."" Loan losses in this year's stress test are broadly comparable to those from past years. Credit card loans showed the highest losses, followed by commercial and industrial loans. Capital is critical to banking organizations, the financial system, and the economy, because it acts as a cushion to absorb losses and helps to ensure that losses are borne by shareholders. The Board uses its own independent projections of losses and incomes for each firm and the results are not forecasts or expected outcomes. Only the largest and most complex banks were tested this year. As previously announced, smaller and less complex banks were not tested this year and are currently on a two-year cycle, consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The firms tested this year represent about 70 percent of the assets of all banks operating in the U.S. Friday's stress tests are one component of the Federal Reserve's analysis during its annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which assesses the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of large bank holding companies and includes an evaluation of their planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and share repurchases.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190624a.htm,Agencies issue final amendments to Regulation CC regarding funds availability,,2019.0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board today jointly published amendments to Regulation CC that implement a statutory requirement to adjust for inflation the amount of funds depository institutions must make available to their customers. The amendments apply in circumstances ranging from next business day withdrawal of certain check deposits to setting the threshold amount for determining whether an account has been repeatedly withdrawn. Regulation CC implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (EFA Act). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the EFA Act to grant the Bureau and the Board joint rulemaking authority for funds-availability schedules, disclosure policies, payment of interest, and other EFA Act provisions implemented by Regulation CC. The Dodd-Frank Act amendments require that the EFA Act's dollar amounts be inflation adjusted every five years by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The first set of adjustments are detailed in the attached Federal Register notice. To help ensure that institutions have sufficient time to implement the adjustments, the compliance date for the adjusted amounts is July 1, 2020. The agencies are also implementing in Regulation CC the EFA Act amendments made by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which include extending coverage of the EFA Act to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190627a.htm,Federal Reserve releases results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR),,2019.0,"The nation's largest banks have strong capital levels and virtually all are now meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning, the Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced following its annual examination. As a result, the Board is not objecting to the capital plans of all 18 firms but is requiring one firm to address limited weaknesses identified from the test. The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluated the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of 18 of the largest banking firms, including the firms' planned capital actions, such as dividend payments and share buybacks. Strong capital levels act as a cushion to absorb losses and help ensure that banking organizations have the ability to lend to households and businesses even in times of stress. ""The stress tests have confirmed that the largest banks are both well capitalized and place a high priority on strong capital planning practices,"" said Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles. ""The results show that these firms and our financial system are resilient in normal times and under stress."" The Board considers both quantitative and qualitative factors when evaluating a bank's capital plan. Quantitative factors include a bank's projected capital ratio under a hypothetical severe recession. Qualitative factors include the firm's capital planning process, including its risk management, internal controls, and governance practices. The Board can object to the capital plans of all banks in CCAR each year on quantitative grounds, and firms that have been in CCAR for less than four years are also subject to an objection on qualitative grounds. If the Board objects to a firm's capital plan, the bank cannot make any capital action unless authorized by the Board. The Board did not object to the capital plan from the U.S. holding company of Credit Suisse, but is requiring the firm to address certain limited weaknesses in its capital planning processes. The Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plans of the remaining 17 firms. On balance, virtually all firms are now meeting the Federal Reserve's capital planning expectations, which is an improvement from last year's assessment. The firms in the test have significantly increased their capital since the first round of stress tests in 2009. In particular, the largest and most complex banks have more than doubled their common equity capital from around $300 billion to roughly $800 billion during that time.

The Volcker Rule generally restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. Under the final rule, which is unchanged from the proposal, community banks with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets are excluded from the Volcker Rule. The final rule also permits a hedge fund or private equity fund, under certain circumstances, to share the same name or a variation of the same name with an investment adviser as long as the adviser is not an insured depository institution, a company that controls an insured depository institution, or a bank holding company.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190709a.htm,Federal Reserve System white paper examines the effects of synthetic identity payments fraud,,2019.0,"Synthetic identity payments fraud is a fast-growing but little-understood problem that affects individuals, financial institutions, government agencies, and private industry. The severity of this type of fraud is documented in a new white paper (PDF) released today by the Federal Reserve System. A synthetic identity (PDF) is created by using a combination of real information (such as a legitimate Social Security number) with fictional information (which can include a made-up name, address or date of birth). Fraudsters increasingly use synthetic identities to commit payments fraud, which can escape detection by today's identity verification and credit-screening processes. Over time, fraudsters build up the creditworthiness of the synthetic identity, then ""bust out"" by purchasing high-value goods and services on credit and disappearing. Because the identity was not real to begin with, there is limited recourse in tracing the perpetrators and holding them responsible for their debts. Consumers whose Social Security numbers have been used for fraud face the time-consuming process of correcting their credit reports. Other consequences of synthetic identity fraud extend beyond payments fraud to include denial of disability benefits, rejection of tax returns, and inaccuracies in health records. ""Crime rings see attractive opportunities in synthetic identity payments fraud,"" said Ken Montgomery, Federal Reserve System payments security strategy leader and chief operating officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""Law enforcement officials, financial institutions, and other organizations recognize it as a growing concern. But unfortunately, many consumers don't realize how it can hurt their access to credit or how to protect themselves,"" he said. ""The white paper provides information on the current state of synthetic identity fraud, including the scope of the issue, causes, contributing factors, and its impact on the payments industry.""

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190709a.htm,Agencies simplify regulatory capital rules,,2019.0,"The federal bank regulatory agencies today issued a final rule that reduces regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies' regulatory capital rules. The simplifications in the final rule only apply to banking organizations that do not use the ""advanced approaches"" capital framework, which are generally firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure. The final rule is intended to simplify and clarify a number of the more complex aspects of the agencies' existing regulatory capital rules. Specifically, it simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interest. The final rule also would allow bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to redeem common stock without prior approval unless otherwise required. Proposed revisions to the definition of high-volatility commercial real estate exposure, which were made in the notice of proposed rulemaking, are being addressed in a separate rulemaking. The final rule is consistent with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report issued by the agencies in 2017. In that report, the agencies committed to meaningfully reducing regulatory burden, especially on community banking organizations, while at the same time maintaining safety and soundness and the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in the banking system. The final rule will be effective as of April 1, 2020, for the amendments to simplify capital rules, and as of October 1, 2019 for revisions to the pre-approval requirements for the redemption of common stock and other technical amendments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190722a.htm,Federal bank regulatory agencies and FinCEN improve transparency of risk-focused BSA/AML supervision,,2019.0,"WASHINGTON â As a result of a working group established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the federal bank regulatory agencies and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today issued a joint statement as part of continuing efforts to improve transparency into their risk-focused approach to Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering (AML) supervision. The risk-focused approach enables federal agencies to better tailor examination plans and procedures based on the unique risk profile of each bank. The statement outlines common practices for assessing a bank's money laundering/terrorist financing risk profile, assisting examiners in scoping and planning the examination and initially evaluating the adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program. Using this approach, the agencies generally are able to allocate more resources to higher-risk areas and fewer resources to lower-risk areas when conducting BSA/AML examinations. The statement does not establish new requirements, and also notes that having a risk-based compliance program enables a bank to allocate compliance resources commensurate with its risk. This statement was developed by a working group aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the BSA/AML regime. Members include the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and FinCEN.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190731a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L. Evans; and Randal K.

The rapid evolution of technology presents a pivotal opportunity for the Federal Reserve and the payment industry to modernize the nation's payment system and establish a safe and efficient foundation for the future. The Federal Reserve believes faster payment services, which enable the near-instantaneous transfer of funds day and night, weekend and weekdays, have the potential to become widely used and to yield economic benefits for individuals and businesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and make time-sensitive payments. Since its founding more than a century ago, the Federal Reserve has provided payment and settlement services, alongside and in cooperation with the private sector, as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe, and efficient U.S. payment system. The Federal Reserve has established over its history a broad reach as a provider of payment and settlement services to the more than 10,000 financial institutions across the country. That reach will help the FedNow Service support a nationwide infrastructure on which the financial services industry may develop innovative faster payment services for the benefit of all Americans. ""Everyone deserves the same ability to make and receive payments immediately and securely, and every bank deserves the same opportunity to offer that service to its community,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard. ""FedNow will permit banks of every size in every community across the country to provide real-time payments to their customers."" In 2018, the Board requested public comment on potential services that could be developed by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments. Of the more than 350 comments that took a position on whether the Federal Reserve should develop a new service for faster payments, over 90 percent supported the Federal Reserve operating a round-the-clock real-time payment and settlement service alongside services provided by the private sector. The Board is now requesting comment on how the new service might be designed to most effectively support the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S. payment system. The Board anticipates the FedNow Service will be available in 2023 or 2024. In addition, the Board is announcing its intention to explore the expansion of Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management in private-sector real-time gross settlement services for faster payments and to support a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.

These operations are aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of the TDF and providing eligible institutions with an opportunity to maintain familiarity with term deposit procedures. The TDF test operations are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.

The Federal Reserve will offer seven-day term deposits with a rate set equal to the sum of the interest rate paid on excess reserves plus a fixed spread of 1 basis point. The maximum tender amount per institution will be $250,000,000. The operation window will be open from 10:30 a.m. EDT to 12:30 p.m. EDT, and awarded deposits will settle the same day the operation is executed.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190906a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on proposal to establish capital requirements for certain insurance companies supervised by the Board,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited public comment on a proposal to establish capital requirements for certain insurance companies supervised by the Board. The proposal builds on existing state-based insurance standards, while also establishing minimum capital requirements that are specific to the business of insurance. Under the proposed framework, known as the Building Block Approach (BBA), holding companies significantly engaged in insurance activities would be required to aggregate their state-based capital requirements into a consolidated requirement. The proposal would establish both minimum requirements and a buffer on top of the minimum. The BBA accounts for risks that are specific to the business of insurance and is different from the calculations used for bank capital requirements. However, the minimum standard under the BBA would be comparable to one of the key measures of banks' health, the minimum total capital ratio, which is set at 8 percent for banks. ""The Building Block Approach looks to the well-known insurance capital standards from state regulators to establish minimum requirements,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. ""Banks and insurance companies can face materially different risks and this proposal takes that into account."" The proposal builds on comments received on a conceptual proposal from June 2016 that described the BBA. The Board supervises depository institution holding companies, including those significantly engaged in insurance actaivities, and the Board currently oversees eight firms. Their insurance activities include life, title, and property and casualty, and the firms range in size from less than $10 billion in total assets to more than $250 billion. As part of the proposal, the Board will conduct a quantitative impact study of the BBA to better inform the framework. The Board also published a white paper that explains the methodology the Board proposes to use to adjust for the differences between different state-based insurance capital requirements and bank capital requirements. Comments on the proposal will be accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190918a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair, John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L. Evans; and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against the action were James Bullard, who preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent; and Esther L. George and Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred to maintain the target range at 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent. Implementation Note issued September 18, 2019",20190918,394

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190927a.htm,"Agencies issue final rule to exempt residential real estate transactions of $400,000 or less from appraisal requirements",,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have adopted a final rule that increases the threshold for residential real estate transactions requiring an appraisal from $250,000 to $400,000. The appraisal threshold was last changed in 1994. Given price appreciation in residential real estate transactions since that time, the change will provide burden relief without posing a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. For transactions exempted from the appraisal requirement, the final rule requires institutions to obtain an evaluation to provide an estimate of the market value of real estate collateral. Evaluations are generally less burdensome than appraisals and have been required since the 1990s. The final rule incorporates the appraisal exemption for rural residential properties provided by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and similarly requires evaluations for these transactions. The final rule also requires institutions to review appraisals for compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The agencies have consulted with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and, as required by statute, have received its concurrence on the increased threshold. The CFPB released its letter concurring that the increased threshold provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1-4 unit single-family residences.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191002a.htm,Agencies issue final rule to update management interlock rules,,2019.0,"The federal bank regulatory agencies today finalized updates to rules restricting the ability of a director or other management official to serve at more than one depository institution or depository holding company. The updates provide relief for community banks that have $10 billion or less in total assets and are unchanged from the proposal announced in December 2018. Previously, the management interlock rules prohibited a management official working at a depository institution or holding company with more than $2.5 billion in total assets from simultaneously working at an unaffiliated depository organization with more than $1.5 billion in total assets. The previous thresholds were established by Congress in 1996. To account for changes in the market, the final rule increases both thresholds to $10 billion in total assets, as the agencies proposed previously. Management officials will generally remain prohibited from serving with multiple depository organizations that are above the new thresholds, limiting the potential risk of anticompetitive conduct at larger institutions. The final rule responds to comments received during the recent review required by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.

By statute, the Volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds. Under the revised rule, firms that do not have significant trading activities will have simplified and streamlined compliance requirements, while firms with significant trading activity will have more stringent compliance requirements. Community banks generally are exempt from the Volcker rule by statute. The revisions continue to prohibit proprietary trading, while providing greater clarity and certainty for activities allowed under the law. With the changes, the agencies expect that the universe of trades that are considered prohibited proprietary trading will remain generally the same as under the agencies' 2013 rule. The changes were jointly developed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191010a.htm,Federal Reserve Board finalizes rules that tailor its regulations for domestic and foreign banks to more closely match their risk profiles,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday finalized rules that tailor its regulations for domestic and foreign banks to more closely match their risk profiles. The rules reduce compliance requirements for firms with less risk while maintaining the most stringent requirements for the largest and most complex banks. The rules establish a framework that sorts banks with $100 billion or more in total assets into four different categories based on several factors, including asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. Significant levels of these factors result in risk and complexity to a bank and can in turn bring risk to the financial system and broader economy. The rules build on the Board's existing practice of tailoring its requirements and are consistent with changes made by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. ""Our rules keep the toughest requirements on the largest and most complex firms,"" Chair Jerome H. Powell said. ""In this way, the rules maintain the fundamental strength and resiliency that has been built into our financial system over the past decade."" While generally similar to the proposals released for comment over the past year, the final rules simplify the proposals by applying liquidity standards to a foreign bank's U.S. intermediate holding company (IHC) based on the risk profile of the IHC, rather than on the combined U.S. operations of the foreign bank. Additionally, for larger firms, the final rules apply standardized liquidity requirements at the higher end of the range that was proposed for both domestic and foreign banks. ""The final rules maintain our objective from the proposals: develop a regulatory framework that more closely ties regulatory requirements to underlying risk,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. As the attached chart indicates, firms in the lowest risk category will have reduced compliance requirements, owing to their smaller risk profile. As the risk of a firm increases and it moves into a new risk category, its requirements will increase. The Board estimates that the changes in the aggregate will result in a 0.6 percent decrease in required capital and a reduction of 2 percent of required liquid assets for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more. The rules do not reduce capital or liquidity requirements for firms in the highest risk categories, including U.S. global systemically important banks. The regulatory capital and liquidity aspects of the rules were jointly developed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191011a.htm,Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation,,2019.0,"Consistent with its January 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. To ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the Committee approved by notation vote completed on October 11, 2019 the following steps:  In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Federal Reserve will purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year in order to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. In addition, the Federal Reserve will conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the FOMC's monetary policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue to monitor money market developments as it assesses the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. The Committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. In connection with these plans, the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  ""Effective October 15, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.""

This proposed policy statement is intended to promote consistency in the interpretation and application of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) credit losses accounting standard, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The proposed interagency policy statement describes the measurement of expected credit losses using the CECL methodology and updates concepts and practices detailed in existing supervisory guidance that remain applicable. CECL is effective for most public financial institutions beginning in 2020, and the FASB recently decided to defer the effective date of CECL for all other institutions to 2023. The proposed interagency policy statement would be effective at the time of each institution's adoption of the credit losses accounting standard. The agencies also are requesting comment on the proposed Interagency Guidance on Credit Risk Review Systems. The guidance presents principles for establishing a system of independent, ongoing credit risk review in accordance with safety and soundness standards. The proposals were issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191028a.htm,Agencies propose rule to amend swap margin rules,,2019.0,"Five federal agencies today announced a proposal to change the swap margin rules to facilitate the implementation of prudent risk management strategies at certain banks and swap entities. The swap margin rule would no longer require swap entities to hold initial margin for uncleared swaps with affiliates. However, inter-affiliate transactions would still be subject to variation margin requirements. Swap entities regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve Board also would be subject to requirements under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Board continues to work on proposed amendments to Regulation W that would, among other things, clarify the treatment of bank-affiliate derivatives under sections 23A and 23B. Inter-affiliate swaps typically are used for internal risk management purposes, by transferring risk to a centralized risk management function within the firm. The proposal would give firms additional flexibility to allocate collateral internally, supporting prudent risk management strategies that support safety and soundness. The proposal would not change the capital standards for swap entities supervised by the five agencies. Furthermore, to aid in the transition away from LIBOR, the agencies proposed to allow certain technical amendments to legacy swaps without altering their status under the swap margin rules. For smaller counterparties, the proposal would provide clarification on documentation requirements and implementation relief. In addition, the proposal would extend the effective date by one year to September 1, 2021, for smaller counterparties to meet initial margin requirements. Comments on the proposal will be accepted for 30 days following publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191028b.htm,Agencies finalize changes to resolution plan requirements; keeps requirements for largest firms and reduces requirements for smaller firms ,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday announced that they had finalized a rule that modifies their resolution plan requirements for large firms. The rule retains resolution plan elements in place for the largest firms, while reducing requirements for smaller firms that pose less risk to the financial system. Resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a firm's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the firm. Since the resolution planning requirements took effect in 2012, the largest firms have improved their resolution strategies and governance, refined their estimates of liquidity and capital needs in resolution, and simplified their legal structures. These changes have made the firms substantially more resilient. The final rule is substantially the same as the proposal from earlier this year. It uses a separate framework developed by the banking agencies for application of prudential requirements, and establishes resolution planning requirements tailored to the level of risk a firm poses to the financial system. The final rule is consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and would affect domestic and foreign firms with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. For the most systemically important firms, the final rule would adopt the current practice of requiring resolution plans to be submitted on a two-year cycle. The final rule would tailor the rule's requirements for firms that do not pose the same systemic risk as the largest institutions, requiring resolution plans to be submitted on a three-year cycle. Both groups of firms would alternate between submitting full resolution plans and targeted resolution plans. Foreign firms with relatively limited U.S. operations would be required to submit reduced resolution plans. A targeted resolution plan would include core elements related to capital, liquidity, and plans for recapitalization, as well as material changes to the firm and areas of interest identified by the agencies. Targeted resolution plans would not include certain areas if they are materially unchanged from one cycle to another, such as descriptions of management information systems and corporate governance systems. As a result, targeted resolution plans would give the agencies meaningful insight into the key vulnerabilities in a firm's resolution strategy. Firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet certain risk criteria would no longer be subject to the rule. These firms have simpler structures, engage more exclusively in traditional banking activity, and present less risk. These changes do not affect the resolution planning requirements under the FDIC's insured depository institution rule for large insured depository institutions, which is part of a separate rulemaking. In a change from the proposal, only smaller and less complex firms could request changes to their full resolution plans and both agencies would need to approve those requests for them to become effective. The attached charts show the new requirements and a list of firms that are expected to be in each category. The rule will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191029a.htm,Federal bank regulatory agencies issue final rule to simplify capital calculation for community banks,,2019.0,"Federal bank regulatory agencies finalized a rule that simplifies capital requirements for community banks by allowing them to adopt a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy. The community bank leverage ratio framework removes requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for a qualifying community bank that opts into the framework. To qualify for the framework, a community bank must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent. In response to public comments and outreach, the final rule was modified from the November 2018 proposal to reduce compliance burden while maintaining safety and soundness for qualifying community banks. In particular, the community bank leverage ratio incorporates tier 1 capital as the numerator. In addition, a community bank that falls out of compliance with the framework will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8 percent. A bank will be deemed well-capitalized during the grace period. The agencies estimate approximately 85 percent of community banks will qualify for the community bank leverage ratio framework. The final rule is consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The community bank leverage ratio framework will first be available for banking organizations to use in their March 31, 2020, Call Report or Form FR Y-9C, as applicable. Banking organizations can opt into or out of the community bank leverage ratio framework in a subsequent Call Report or Form FR Y-9C, as applicable. The agencies have prepared a compliance guide to accompany the rule. In addition, the agencies finalized a rule to allow non-advanced approaches banks, including community banks, to elect to adopt simplifying changes to the capital rule beginning on January 1, 2020, a quarter earlier than the mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. The agencies issued the simplifying changes in July 2019.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191030a.htm,Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,,2019.0,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H. Clarida; Charles L. Evans; and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action were: Esther L. George and Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the target range at 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent.

The threshold amount will be effective January 1, 2020, and is based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as of June 1, 2019. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the Truth in Lending Act to add special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, including a requirement that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the home's interior before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less and also provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the CPI-W. If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.

These thresholds are set pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act that require adjusting these thresholds annually based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2019, the protections of the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $58,300 or less in 2020. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property (such as mortgages) are subject to the Truth in Lending Act regardless of the amount of the loan.

The extension would provide additional time for foreign jurisdictions' versions of the rule to become effective and would apply only to the combined U.S. operations of the foreign banks and not to any U.S. intermediate holding companies of those banks. In June 2018, the Board finalized a rule to enhance financial stability by limiting the exposure that a large domestic or foreign bank can have to another counterparty. The rule applied those limits to both the intermediate holding company and combined U.S. operations of foreign banks. For the limits applied to combined U.S. operations, the Board's rule allows a foreign bank to comply by certifying that it meets a similar rule or standard of its home country. To date, certain foreign jurisdictions are in the process of finalizing their rules or standards. The extension would allow additional time for foreign banks to comply with the Board's rule via certification with a similar home country rule or standard.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191119c.htm,Federal bank regulatory agencies finalize rule to update calculation of counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts,,2019.0,"Three federal bank regulatory agencies on Tuesday jointly announced a final rule updating how certain banking organizations are required to measure counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts under their regulatory capital rules. The final rule implements the ""standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk,"" also known as SA-CCR. This updated methodology better reflects improvements made to the derivatives market since the 2007-2008 financial crisis such as central clearing and margin requirements. SA-CCR would replace the ""current exposure methodology"" for large, internationally active banking organizations, while other, smaller banking organizations could voluntarily adopt SA-CCR. While generally consistent with the proposal released for comment in October 2018, the final rule has been revised in response to comments from the public. Those changes include revised capital requirements for derivatives contracts with commercial end-user counterparties. The agencies estimate that the final rule will not materially change the current amount of capital in the banking system, though the effect on individual banking organizations will vary depending on their portfolios. The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly issued the final rule. It will be effective on April 1, 2020, with a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022.

The final rule is unchanged from the proposal issued for public comment in April 2019. The EGRRCPA requires the agencies to permit certain banking organizationsâthose predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activitiesâto exclude qualifying deposits at certain central banks from their supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio is one of many tools used by the federal bank regulatory agencies to determine minimum required capital levels and ensure financial stability in the event of stress in the banking system. It applies only to large or complex internationally active banking organizations. Based on current data, only The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Northern Trust Corporation, and State Street Corporation, together with their depository institution subsidiaries, would qualify for the rule.

The Board evaluated the application under the factors it is required to consider under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the financial and managerial resources of the companies, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the combined organization, and the competitive and financial stability impacts of the proposal. The Board's approval is conditioned on several actions, including that BB&T must divest 30 branches and more than $2.4 billion in deposits to mitigate the competitive effects of the merger. Also on Tuesday, the Board issued a consent order against SunTrust for unfair and deceptive practices. As detailed in the order, SunTrust made misleading or inaccurate statements between 2013 and 2017 to certain business customers about the operation and billing for certain add-on products. SunTrust previously terminated these practices and, since 2016, has repaid approximately $8.8 million in fees to customers. As a condition of the merger, BB&T has committed that the resulting bank will comply with the enforcement action, including implementing procedures to verify the refunds and providing additional refunds, if required. Lastly, the Board announced that it will not object to the updated capital plan submitted by BB&T to reflect the merger. The merger order and enforcement action order are attached.

These amounts are used in the calculation of reserve requirements for depository institutions. The Board also announced the annual indexing of nonexempt deposit cutoff and the reduced reporting limit. All depository institutions must hold a percentage of certain types of deposits as reserves in the form of vault cash, as a deposit in a Federal Reserve Bank, or as a deposit in a pass-through account at a correspondent institution. Reserve requirements currently are assessed on the depository institution's net transaction accounts (mostly checking accounts). Depository institutions must also regularly submit reports of their deposits and other reservable liabilities. For net transaction accounts in 2020, the first $16.9 million, up from $16.3 million in 2019, will be exempt from reserve requirements. A 3 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts over $16.9 million up to and including $127.5 million, up from $124.2 million in 2019. A 10 percent reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts in excess of $127.5 million. These annual adjustments, known as the reserve requirement exemption amount adjustment and the low reserve tranche adjustment, are based on growth in total reservable liabilities and net transaction accounts, respectively, at all depository institutions between June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. The new low reserve tranche and reserve requirement exemption amount will apply to the 14-day reserve maintenance period that begins January 16, 2020. For depository institutions that report deposit data weekly, this maintenance period aligns with the 14-day computation period that begins Tuesday, December 17, 2019. For depository institutions that report deposit data quarterly, this maintenance period aligns with the seven-day computation period that begins Tuesday, December 17, 2019. The Board also made the annual adjustments to the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit. These amounts are used to determine the frequency with which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20191125a.htm,Federal Reserve Board publishes report on bank branch access in rural communities,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday released Perspectives from Main Street: Bank Branch Access in Rural Communities, a report that examines how rural consumers and small businesses use bank branches and how their communities have been affected by branch closures. Of the counties analyzed in the report, more than half lost bank branches between 2012 and 2017, with some predominantly rural counties experiencing considerable declines. The deeply affected rural counties tended to be less economically well off and have residents with lower levels of education. They also had a greater proportion of minority residents relative to other rural counties. Much of the information in the report was gathered at listening sessions hosted by Federal Reserve Banks across the country between July 2018 and January 2019. The consumers, small business owners, and local government officials who participated in the sessions said that while they have found local or technological substitutes for many, but not all services, the alternatives are generally more costly and less convenient. Other data and research presented in the report show that despite the increasing use of digital methods to access financial services, branches continue to be important for certain services, including resolving problems, submitting loan applications, and for deposits and withdrawals. The data also show that a majority of small businesses prefer to utilize local banks to access financial services, which may give them greater credit availability and more favorable credit terms. These businesses expressed concern that loan product costs and terms were not always transparent when accessing credit through online lenders. The research reviewed also found that adoption of digital banking services has been more gradual among consumers who are older, have lower incomes or fewer years of formal education, or who live in rural areas. This lower adoption rate suggests that bank branch closures may present greater challenges for these individuals.

The Reserve Banks project that they will recover 100.2 percent of their priced services costs in 2020. The Reserve Banks expect to fully recover actual and imputed expenses, including profit that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, the Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes will result in a 2.4 percent average price increase. The Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes will result in a 3.3 percent average price increase for Check Services customers; a 3.7 percent average price increase for Fedwire® Funds Service customers; and a 2.9 percent average price increase for FedLine® Solutions customers. Fees will remain unchanged for the Reserve Banks' FedACH® Service, National Settlement Service, and Fedwire® Securities Service. The 2020 fee schedule for each of the priced services is available on the Federal Reserve Banks' financial services website at FRBservices.orgSM. The Board also approved the 2020 private-sector adjustment factor (PSAF) of $18.9 million for Reserve Bank priced services. The PSAF is an allowance for income taxes and other imputed expenses that would have been paid and profit that would have been earned if the Reserve Banks' priced services were provided by a private business. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 requires that the Federal Reserve establish fees to recover the costs of providing priced services, including imputed costs, over the long run, to promote competition between the Reserve Banks and private-sector service providers.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191203a.htm,Agencies clarify requirements for providing financial services to hemp-related businesses,,2019.0,"WASHINGTONâFour federal agencies in conjunction with the state bank regulators today issued a statement clarifying the legal status of hemp growth and production and the relevant requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for banks providing services to hemp-related businesses. The statement emphasizes that banks are no longer required to file suspicious activity reports (SAR) for customers solely because they are engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. For hemp-related customers, banks are expected to follow standard SAR procedures, and file a SAR if indicia of suspicious activity warrants. This statement provides banks with background information on the legal status of hemp, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) interim final rule on the production of hemp, and the BSA considerations when providing banking services to hemp-related businesses. This statement also indicates that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) will issue additional guidance after further reviewing and evaluating the USDA interim final rule. The statement was issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FinCEN, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Banks can contact the USDA, state departments of agriculture, and tribal governments with further questions regarding the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill) and its implementing regulations.

The statement from the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) notes the benefits that using alternative data may provide to consumers, such as expanding access to credit and enabling consumers to obtain additional products and more favorable pricing and terms. The statement explains that a well-designed compliance management program provides for a thorough analysis of relevant consumer protection laws and regulations to ensure firms understand the opportunities, risks, and compliance requirements before using alternative data. Alternative data includes information not typically found in consumers' credit reports or customarily provided by consumers when applying for credit. Alternative data include cash flow data derived from consumers' bank account records. The agencies recognize that use of alternative data in a manner consistent with applicable consumer protection laws may improve the speed and accuracy of credit decisions and may help firms evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers who currently may not obtain credit in the mainstream credit system.

Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12âmonth basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1â1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191217a.htm,Agencies find no deficiencies in resolution plans from the largest banks; find shortcomings for several firms,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced Tuesday that they did not find any ""deficiencies,"" which are weaknesses that could result in additional prudential requirements if not corrected, in the resolution plans of the largest and most complex domestic banks. However, plans from six of the eight banks had ""shortcomings,"" which are weaknesses that raise questions about the feasibility of a firm's plan, but are not as severe as a deficiency. Plans to address the shortcomings are due to the agencies by March 31, 2020. Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, describe a bank's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. In the plans of Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo, the agencies found shortcomings related to the ability of the firms to reliably produce, in stressed conditions, data needed to execute their resolution strategy. Examples include measures of capital and liquidity at relevant subsidiaries. The agencies did not find shortcomings in the plans from Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase. The firms will receive feedback letters, which will be publicly available on the Board's website. For the six firms whose plans have shortcomings, the letter details the specific weaknesses and the actions required. Overall, the letters note that each firm made significant progress in enhancing its resolvability and developing resolution-related capabilities but all firms will need to continue to make progress in certain areas. To that end, the letters confirm the agencies expect to focus on testing the resolution capabilities of the firms when reviewing their next plans. Resolving a large bank would be challenging and unprecedented, and the agencies expect the firms to remain vigilant as markets change and as firms' activities, structures, and risk profiles change.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20191219a.htm,Federal Reserve payments study finds growth in card and automated clearinghouse payments,,2019.0,"The growth of payments using debit and credit cards and the automated clearinghouse (ACH) system continued to accelerate from 2015 to 2018, while check payments continued their long-run decline, according to U.S. noncash payments data collected by the Federal Reserve. The 2019 Federal Reserve Payments Study shows that the growth rate of core noncash payments, defined for the report as debit card, credit card, ACH, and check payments, was 6.7 percent per year between 2015 and 2018. During the prior three-year survey period, core noncash payments grew at a rate of 5.1 percent per year. These core noncash payment types have retained their ability to be used in traditional ways even while they increasingly function as the means of settlement for innovative types of alternative payment methods and services, such as smartphone and internet-based services. Total card payments (both credit and debit), which represented 7.3 percent of core noncash payments by value and 75.3 percent by number in 2018, grew at a rate of 8.9 percent per year between 2015 and 2018âup from the 6.8 percent yearly rate of increase from 2012 to 2015. Debit cards, including both prepaid and non-prepaid, were used almost twice as often as credit cards in 2018, but the value of credit card payments exceeded the value of debit card payments by almost 30 percent. For general-purpose (network-branded) cards overall, the value of remote payments in 2018 nearly equaled in-person payments, driven in part by growing e-commerce card payments and the use of cards for recurring bill payments. More than half of in-person general-purpose card payments were chip authenticated in 2018, compared to 2.0 percent in 2015. The number of ACH credit and debit transfers grew by 6.0 percent per year between 2015 and 2018, exceeding the 4.9 percent per-year growth rate recorded for 2012 to 2015. Payments made by checks fell 7.2 percent per year from 2015 to 2018, a faster rate of decline than the 2.8 percent yearly rate seen over the prior three years but in line with declines posted from 2003 to 2012. The number of check payments declined to 14.5 billion in 2018âfalling for the first time below the number of ACH debit transfers. The rate of decline for ATM cash withdrawals slowed compared with the previous three years, falling 0.9 percent per year from 2015 to 2018. The decline in the number, combined with an increase in value, resulted in average ATM cash withdrawals of $156 in 2018, compared to $146 in 2015. The Federal Reserve Payments Study is a collaborative effort of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to track and document developments in the U.S. payments system through the collection of quantitative survey data.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20191219b.htm,Federal Reserve report assesses information presented to prospective borrowers on small business online lender websites,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released Uncertain Terms: What Small Business Borrowers Find When Browsing Online Lender Websites, a report that examines the information that prospective small business borrowers encounter when researching and comparing credit products offered by online lenders. Nonbank online lenders are becoming more mainstream alternative providers of financing to small businesses. In 2018, nearly one-third of small business owners seeking credit reported having applied at a nonbank online lender. The industry's growing reach has the potential to expand access to credit for small firms, but also raises concerns about how product costs and features are disclosed. The report's analysis of a sampling of online content finds significant variation in the amount of upfront information provided, especially on costs. On some sites, descriptions feature little or no information about the actual products or about rates, fees, and repayment terms. Lenders that offer term loans are likely to show costs as an annual rate, while others convey costs using terminology that may be unfamiliar to prospective borrowers. Details on interest rates, if shown, are most often found in footnotes, fine print, or frequently asked questions. The report's findings build on prior work, including two rounds of focus groups with small business owners who reported challenges with the lack of standardization in product descriptions and with understanding product terms and costs. In addition, the report finds that a number of websites require prospective borrowers to furnish information about themselves and their businesses in order to obtain details about product costs and terms. Lenders' policies permit any data provided by the small business owner to be used by the lender and other third parties to contact business owners, often leading to bothersome sales calls. Moreover, online lenders make frequent use of trackers to monitor visitors on their websites. Even when visitors do not share identifying information with the lender, embedded trackers may collect data on how they navigate the website as well as other sites visited. The report is available at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/what-small-business-borrowers-find-when-browsing-online-lender-websites.pdf.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20191223a.htm,Federal Reserve approves modifications to National Settlement Service and Fedwire® Funds Service to support enhancements to the same-day automated clearinghouse service,,2019.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Monday approved modifications to the Federal Reserve Banks' National Settlement Service (NSS) and Fedwire® Funds Service to support enhancements to the same-day automated clearinghouse (ACH) service. The Board also approved changes intended to reduce the risk that the modified service closings and cutoffs would increase the frequency of delays to the reopening of the Fedwire Funds Service. Finally, the Board approved corresponding changes to the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk (PSR policy) related to a new posting time for transactions and an increased daylight overdraft fee. On September 13, 2018, Nacha, the rules and standards body for the ACH network, announced that its voting members had approved amendments to the Nacha Operating Rules & Guidelines to establish a third and later same-day ACH processing and settlement window with a settlement deadline of 4:45 p.m. ET and settlement at 6:00 p.m. ET. A third same-day ACH window aligns with the Federal Reserve's ongoing objective to support improved speed and efficiency of the payment system in the United States as well as public interest in greater availability of payment services. In particular, the later same-day ACH window would allow more institutions to use same-day ACH services during a greater portion of their business day and may promote greater adoption of same-day ACH and availability of the service to originators and end-users. The amended Nacha rules changes require modifications to the Federal Reserve Banks' payment service closings and cutoffs so that the private-sector ACH operator, The Clearing House Payments Company L.L.C., can settle same-day ACH transactions later in the day via the National Settlement Service. On May 16, 2019, the Board published a Federal Register notice seeking public comment on these modifications to the Federal Reserve Bank's payment services. After analyzing the comments received, the Board has approved the following modifications and enhancements to be implemented in March 2021, which would accommodate Nacha's current effective date of March 19, 2021 for implementing the later same-day ACH window:  The National Settlement Service will close at 6:30 p.m. ET, one hour later than its current closing at 5:30 p.m. ET. The opening time for the National Settlement Service will remain at 7:30 a.m. ET. The Fedwire Funds Service will close at 7:00 p.m. ET, 30 minutes later than its current cutoff at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Fedwire Funds third-party cutoff will occur at 6:45 p.m. ET, 45 minutes later than its current cutoff at 6:00 p.m. ET. The opening time for the Fedwire Funds Service will remain at 9 p.m. ET on the previous calendar day. The Reserve Banks will modify their current practice of maintaining a two-hour window between the closing and the reopening of the Fedwire Funds Service to maintain only a 90-minute window. The Reserve Banks will raise the threshold for granting extensions to the Fedwire Funds Service closing time from $1 billion to $3 billion. The Reserve Banks, in consultation with the Board, will determine whether further increases to the threshold are warranted to maintain the regular and consistent open of the Fedwire Funds Service at 9:00 p.m. ET. The Board is amending part II of the PSR policy to add a new 6:00 p.m. ET posting time for same-day ACH transactions, remove the current 5:30 p.m. ET posting time for ACH return transactions, and make conforming changes to the daylight overdraft fee calculation.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20191231a.htm,Agencies release annual CRA asset-size threshold adjustments for small and intermediate small institutions,,2019.0,"WASHINGTONâThe federal bank regulatory agencies today announced the annual adjustment to the asset-size thresholds used to define small bank, small savings association, intermediate small bank, and intermediate small savings association under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations. The annual adjustments are required by the CRA rules. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. Those meeting the small and intermediate small institution asset-size thresholds are not subject to the reporting requirements applicable to large banks and savings associations unless they choose to be evaluated as a large institution. Annual adjustments to these asset-size thresholds are based on the change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million. As a result of the 1.62 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2019, the definitions of small and intermediate small institutions for CRA examinations will change as follows:  ""Small bank"" or ""small savings association"" means an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.305 billion. ""Intermediate small bank"" or ""intermediate small savings association"" means a small institution with assets of at least $326 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.305 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.  These asset-size threshold adjustments are effective January 1, 2020. The agencies will publish the final rule in the Federal Register. In addition, the agencies will post a list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds on the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (https://www.ffiec.gov/cra).

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200110a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces Reserve Bank income and expense data and transfers to the Treasury for 2019,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced preliminary results indicating that the Reserve Banks provided for payments of approximately $54.9 billion to the U.S. Treasury. The 2019 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in March and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results. The Federal Reserve Banks' 2019 estimated net income of $55.5 billion represents a decrease of $7.6 billion from 2018. The decline in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease of $9.5 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations and a $1.5 billion increase in interest expense on securities sold under agreement to repurchase. A $3.5 billion decrease in interest expense associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions partially offset those factors. Net income for 2019 was derived primarily from $102.8 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations--U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities, and GSE debt securities. The Federal Reserve Banks had interest expense of $35.0 billion primarily associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions, and incurred interest expense of $6.0 billion on securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Operating expenses of the Reserve Banks, net of amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury and other entities for services the Reserve Banks provided as fiscal agents, totaled $4.5 billion in 2019. In addition, the Reserve Banks were assessed $837 million for the costs related to producing, issuing, and retiring currency, $814 million for Board expenditures, and $519 million to fund the operations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additional earnings were derived from income from services of $444 million. Statutory dividends totaled $714 million in 2019.

If a company has control over a banking organization, the company generally becomes subject to the Board's rules and regulations. The final rule is largely consistent with the proposal, establishing a comprehensive and public framework to determine when a company controls a bank or a bank controls a company. Previously, control reviews have been situation-specific and often followed precedents that were not available to firms or to the public. The framework uses several factors to determine if a company has control over a bank. The key factors include the company's total voting and non-voting equity investment in the bank; director, officer, and employee overlaps between the company and the bank; and the scope of business relationships between the company and the bank. The rule clarifies and increases transparency by describing the combination of factors that would and would not trigger control concerns. The attached chart shows how different combinations of factors would or would not raise control concerns. The rule will be effective on April 1.

Since the regulations implementing the Volcker rule were finalized in 2013, the rule has created compliance uncertainty and imposed limits on certain banking services and activities that the Volcker rule was not intended to restrict. To address these concerns, the agencies simplified requirements for the proprietary trading restrictions in November 2019. Today's proposal would modify the restrictions for banking entities investing in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds. In particular, the joint agency proposal would improve and streamline the covered funds portion of the rule, address the treatment of certain foreign funds, and permit banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other permissible activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker rule was intended to address.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200131a.htm,Shared National Credit Review finds risk remains elevated in leveraged loans,,2020.0,"WASHINGTONâFederal bank regulatory agencies find that the share and amount of loan commitments with the lowest supervisory ratings rose slightly between 2018 and 2019, according to the Shared National Credit (SNC) Program Review. Total commitments with low ratings remain elevated compared to lows reached during prior periods of strong economic performance. The report, which was released today by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), reflects reviews primarily covering SNC loans originated on or before June 30, 2019. It finds that credit risk associated with leveraged lending remains elevated. Lenders have fewer protections and risks have increased in leveraged loan terms through the current long period of economic expansion since the last recession. Most banks have adopted credit risk-management practices to monitor and control this evolving risk. However, some of these controls have not been tested in an economic downturn. The agencies require banks to have risk-management processes that can identify and adapt to changing market conditions. The 2019 SNC portfolio included 5,474 borrowers, totaling $4.8 trillion, up from $4.4 trillion in 2018. U.S. banks held the greatest volume of SNC commitments at 44.4 percent of the portfolio, followed by foreign banking organizations and other investor entities such as securitization pools, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds. Total commitments increased by $396 billion, or 8.9 percent, from third quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2019. Growth was concentrated in investment grade equivalent transactions. The number of borrowers and facilities increased modestly in 2019 after a sizeable decline in 2018 associated with an increase in the minimum commitment threshold to $100 million that was effective January 1, 2018 Loan commitments were reviewed and grouped into four categories by the severity of their risk, from less severe to more severe: special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. The last three of which are known as ""classified."" Overall, the level of loans rated below ""pass"" as a percentage of the total SNC portfolio increased slightly from 6.7 percent to 6.9 percent. Bank-identified leveraged loan commitments represent 49 percent of total SNC commitments. Leveraged lending was the primary contributor to the overall special mention and classified rates. Investors outside the banking industry held the greatest volume of special mention and classified commitments, followed by U.S. banks and foreign banking organizations. The agencies conduct SNC reviews in the first and third calendar quarters with some banks receiving two reviews and others receiving a single review each year. The agencies issue a single statement annually that includes combined findings from the previous 12 months. This practice presents a complete view of the entire SNC portfolio, which can be compared with prior years' reports. The next report will be published following the third quarter 2020 SNC examination. For additional information, see the attached SNC Program Review Report.

Goldman arranged bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysia's state-owned development and investment company. The consent order states that Vella failed to escalate Low Taek Jho's involvement in the bond offerings. Low was a person of known concern to Goldman, and his involvement indicated heightened potential underwriting risks. Low and two former Goldman employees, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, have been criminally charged by the Department of Justice for participating in a scheme to divert proceeds of the bond offerings from 1MDB for their personal benefit and bribing certain government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. In March 2019, the Board permanently prohibited Leissner from banking and fined him $1.42 million for his role in the scheme to divert bond proceeds. Ng is currently prohibited from banking by the Board. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.     Attachment (PDF)",20200204,179

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200206a.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases hypothetical scenarios for its 2020 stress test exercises,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the hypothetical scenarios for the 2020 stress test exercises, which ensure that large banks have adequate capital and processes so that they can continue lending to households and businesses, even during a severe recession. The harshest scenario includes a severe global recession with heightened stresses in corporate debt markets and commercial real estate, and for banks with large trading operations, additional pressure on leveraged loans. The Board's stress test framework consists of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, also known as CCAR, and the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests. Both exercises have been a cornerstone of the Board's post-crisis framework for large banks, and this year's stress tests will evaluate 34 large banks with more than $100 billion in total assets. The stress tests include two hypothetical scenarios: baseline and severely adverse. The severely adverse scenario this year features a severe global recession in which the U.S. unemployment rate rises by 6.5 percentage points to 10 percent, and elevated stress in corporate debt markets and commercial real estate. Additionally, banks with large trading operations will be required to factor in a global market shock component as part of their scenarios. This year's shock features, among other things, heightened stress to trading book exposures to leveraged loans. Additionally, firms with substantial trading or processing operations will be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario component. The chart below shows the components that apply to each firm. ""This year's stress test will help us evaluate how large banks perform during a severe recession, and give us increased information on how leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations may respond to a recession,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. The severely adverse scenario and baseline scenarios are not forecasts. The severely adverse scenario describes a hypothetical sets of events designed to assess the strength of banking organizations. Similarly, the baseline scenario is in line with average projections from surveys of economic forecasters. Each scenario includes 28 variablesâsuch as gross domestic product, the unemployment rate, stock market prices, and interest ratesâcovering domestic and international economic activity. Banks are required to submit their capital plans and the results of their own stress tests to the Federal Reserve by April 6, 2020. The Board will announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30, 2020. As previously stated, the Board continues to work toward having the stress capital buffer in place for this year's stress tests. The release of the hypothetical scenarios does not affect that separate rulemaking process.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200304a.htm,"Federal Reserve Board approves rule to simplify its capital rules for large banks, preserving the strong capital requirements already in place",,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday approved a rule to simplify its capital rules for large banks, preserving the strong capital requirements already in place. The ""stress capital buffer,"" or SCB, integrates the Board's stress test results with its non-stress capital requirements. As a result, required capital levels for each firm would more closely match its risk profile and likely losses as measured via the Board's stress tests. The rule is broadly similar to the proposal from April 2018, with a few changes in response to comments. ""The stress capital buffer materially simplifies the post-crisis capital framework for banks, while maintaining the strong capital requirements that are the hallmark of the framework,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. The SCB uses the results from the Board's supervisory stress tests, which are one component of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), to help determine each firm's capital requirements for the coming year. By combining the Board's stress testsâwhich project the capital needs of each firm under adverse economic conditionsâwith the Board's non-stress capital requirements, large banks will now be subject to a single, forward-looking, and risk-sensitive capital framework. The simplification would result in banks needing to meet eight capital requirements, instead of the current 13. The SCB framework preserves the strong capital requirements established after the financial crisis. In particular, the changes would increase capital requirements for the largest and most complex banks and decrease requirements for less complex banks. Based on stress test data from 2013 to 2019, common equity tier 1 capital requirements would increase by $11 billion in aggregate, a 1 percent increase from current capital requirements. A firm's SCB will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on several factors, including the firm's risks. To reduce the incentive for firms to take on risk and further simplify the framework, the final rule does not include a stress leverage buffer as proposed. All banks would continue to be subject to ongoing, non-stress leverage requirements. Large banks have substantially increased their capital since the first round of stress tests in 2009. The common equity capital ratio of the banks in the 2019 CCAR has more than doubled from 4.9 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, with total capital doubling to more than $1 trillion. Also on Wednesday, the Board released the instructions for the 2020 CCAR cycle. The instructions confirm that 34 banks will participate in this year's test. CCAR consists of both the stress tests that assess firms' capital needs under stress and, for the largest and most complex banks, a qualitative evaluation of the practices these firms use to determine their capital needs in normal times and under stress. Results will be released by June 30. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200306b.htm,Agencies invite comment on updates to resolution plan guidance for large foreign banks,,2020.0,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited public comment on proposed changes to the guidance for resolution plans submitted by large foreign banks, including plans that are due by July 1, 2021. The updates focus on the agencies' expectations around a firm's derivatives and trading activities and payment, clearing, and settlement activities. Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. The resolution planning process helps ensure that a firm's failure would not have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. For foreign banking organizations, resolution plans are focused on their U.S. subsidiaries and operations. The proposed guidance is largely similar to the guidance from March 2017, and includes certain updates based on the agencies' review of the firms' most recent resolution plans and changes to the resolution planning rules. The proposed guidance also seeks comment on objective, quantitative criteria to determine its applicability. As of the date of the proposal, the firms that meet the proposed criteria are the U.S. operations of Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank. Comments on this proposal will be accepted for 60 days. Also on Friday, the Board announced that due to the substantial and sustained decrease in risk from the U.S. operations of UBS AG, it will now be supervised as part of its Large and Foreign Banking Organization supervision portfolio. The Board made this change after a comprehensive determination of the risks from the firm. As an example, the firm has decreased from roughly $375 billion to less than $200 billion in total assets over the past decade, and separate measures of complexity have also declined. As a result of this change, the firm will be supervised alongside other banks of similar risk. This change will have no effect on the regulatory capital or liquidity requirements for the firm or the Board's ability to supervise the activities of the firm.

The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at www.fema.gov. Lending: Financial institutions should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by tornadoes in Tennessee. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. In supervising institutions affected by tornadoes in Tennessee, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the tornadoes in Tennessee. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by tornadoes in Tennessee. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by tornadoes in Tennessee may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by tornadoes in Tennessee that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the effects of tornadoes in Tennessee. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by tornadoes in Tennessee. Institutions should monitor municipal securities and loans affected by tornadoes in Tennessee. Appropriate monitoring and prudent efforts to stabilize such investments are encouraged.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm,Federal Reserve Actions to Support the Flow of Credit to Households and Businesses,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring credit markets and is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals. In addition to actions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee, including actions taken in coordination with other central banks, the Federal Reserve Board announced a series of actions in support of these goals. These actions are summarized below. Discount Window Federal Reserve lending to depository institutions (the ""discount window"") plays an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system and the effective implementation of monetary policy. By providing ready access to funding, the discount window helps depository institutions manage their liquidity risks efficiently and avoid actions that have negative consequences for their customers, such as withdrawing credit during times of market stress. Thus, the discount window supports the smooth flow of credit to households and businesses. Providing liquidity in this way is one of the original purposes of the Federal Reserve System and other central banks around the world. The Federal Reserve encourages depository institutions to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from households and businesses at this time. In support of this goal, the Board today announced that it will lower the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to 0.25 percent, effective March 16, 2020. This reduction in the primary credit rate reflects both the 100 basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate and a 50 basis point narrowing in the primary credit rate relative to the top of the target range. Narrowing the spread of the primary credit rate relative to the general level of overnight interest rates should help encourage more active use of the window by depository institutions to meet unexpected funding needs. To further enhance the role of the discount window as a tool for banks in addressing potential funding pressures, the Board also today announced that depository institutions may borrow from the discount window for periods as long as 90 days, prepayable and renewable by the borrower on a daily basis. The Federal Reserve continues to accept the same broad range of collateral for discount window loans. Intraday Credit The availability of intraday credit from the Federal Reserve supports the smooth functioning of payment systems and the settlement and clearing of transactions across a range of credit markets. The Federal Reserve encourages depository institutions to utilize intraday credit extended by Reserve Banks, on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis, to support the provision of liquidity to households and businesses and the general smooth functioning of payment systems. Bank Capital and Liquidity Buffers The Federal Reserve is encouraging banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses who are affected by the coronavirus. Since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, U.S. bank holding companies have built up substantial levels of capital and liquidity in excess of regulatory minimums and buffers. The largest firms have $1.3 trillion in common equity and hold $2.9 trillion in high quality liquid assets. The U.S. banking agencies have also significantly increased capital and liquidity requirements, including improving the quality of regulatory capital, raising minimum capital requirements, establishing capital and liquidity buffers, and implementing annual capital stress tests. These capital and liquidity buffers are designed to support the economy in adverse situations and allow banks to continue to serve households and businesses. The Federal Reserve supports firms that choose to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend and undertake other supportive actions in a safe and sound manner. Reserve Requirements For many years, reserve requirements played a central role in the implementation of monetary policy by creating a stable demand for reserves. In January 2019, the FOMC announced its intention to implement monetary policy in an ample reserves regime. Reserve requirements do not play a significant role in this operating framework. In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period. This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

They are:  A statement encouraging banks to use their resources to support households and businesses; and A technical change to phase in, as intended, the automatic distribution restrictions gradually if a firm's capital levels decline.  The statement notes that banks have more than doubled their capital and liquidity levels over the past decade and are now substantially safer and stronger than they were previously. As a result, the agencies are encouraging banks to use that strength to support households and businesses. The statement is substantially similar to one issued by the Federal Reserve Board earlier this week. The technical change is an interim final rule that, if a bank's capital declines by a certain amount, phases in the agencies' automatic distribution restrictions gradually, as intended. Like the statement, the interim final rule facilitates the use of firms' capital buffers to promote lending activity to households and businesses.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200317a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces establishment of a Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board announced today that it will establish a Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Commercial paper markets directly finance a wide range of economic activity, supplying credit and funding for auto loans and mortgages as well as liquidity to meet the operational needs of a range of companies. By ensuring the smooth functioning of this market, particularly in times of strain, the Federal Reserve is providing credit that will support families, businesses, and jobs across the economy. The CPFF will provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that will purchase unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper rated A1/P1 (as of March 17, 2020) directly from eligible companies. The CPFF program is established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Treasury Secretary. The commercial paper market has been under considerable strain in recent days as businesses and households face greater uncertainty in light of the coronavirus outbreak. By eliminating much of the risk that eligible issuers will not be able to repay investors by rolling over their maturing commercial paper obligations, this facility should encourage investors to once again engage in term lending in the commercial paper market. An improved commercial paper market will enhance the ability of businesses to maintain employment and investment as the nation deals with the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury will provide $10 billion of credit protection to the Federal Reserve in connection with the CPFF from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The Federal Reserve will then provide financing to the SPV under the CPFF. Its loans will be secured by all of the assets of the SPV. A brief description of the program is attached.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200322a.htm,Agencies provide additional information to encourage financial institutions to work with borrowers affected by COVID-19,,2020.0,"The federal financial institution regulatory agencies and the state banking regulators issued an interagency statement encouraging financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19 and providing additional information regarding loan modifications. The agencies encourage financial institutions to work with borrowers, will not criticize institutions for doing so in a safe and sound manner, and will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The joint statement also provides supervisory views on past-due and nonaccrual regulatory reporting of loan modification programs. The agencies view prudent loan modification programs offered to financial institution customers affected by COVID-19 as positive and proactive actions that can manage or mitigate adverse impacts on borrowers, and lead to improved loan performance and reduced credit risk. The statement reminds institutions that not all modifications of loan terms result in a TDR. Short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. This includes short-termâfor example, six monthsâmodifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. The agencies' examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications, including TDRs, and will not automatically adversely risk rate credits that are affected, including those considered TDRs. Regardless of whether modifications are considered TDRs or are adversely classified, agency examiners will not criticize prudent efforts to modify terms on existing loans for affected customers.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm,Federal Reserve announces extensive new measures to support the economy,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support households, businesses, and the U.S. economy overall in this challenging time. The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world. Our nation's first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate. The Federal Reserve's role is guided by its mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices, along with its responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. In support of these goals, the Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses. These actions include:  Support for critical market functioning. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy. The FOMC had previously announced it would purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the FOMC will include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage-backed security purchases. Supporting the flow of credit to employers, consumers, and businesses by establishing new programs that, taken together, will provide up to $300 billion in new financing. The Department of the Treasury, using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), will provide $30 billion in equity to these facilities. Establishment of two facilities to support credit to large employers â the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) for new bond and loan issuance and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. Establishment of a third facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses. The TALF will enable the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and certain other assets. Facilitating the flow of credit to municipalities by expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) and bank certificates of deposit. Facilitating the flow of credit to municipalities by expanding the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to include high-quality, tax-exempt commercial paper as eligible securities. In addition, the pricing of the facility has been reduced.  In addition to the steps above, the Federal Reserve expects to announce soon the establishment of a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to eligible small-and-medium sized businesses, complementing efforts by the SBA. The PMCCF will allow companies access to credit so that they are better able to maintain business operations and capacity during the period of dislocations related to the pandemic. This facility is open to investment grade companies and will provide bridge financing of four years. Borrowers may elect to defer interest and principal payments during the first six months of the loan, extendable at the Federal Reserve's discretion, in order to have additional cash on hand that can be used to pay employees and suppliers. The Federal Reserve will finance a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to make loans from the PMCCF to companies. The Treasury, using the ESF, will make an equity investment in the SPV. The SMCCF will purchase in the secondary market corporate bonds issued by investment grade U.S. companies and U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for U.S. investment grade corporate bonds. Treasury, using the ESF, will make an equity investment in the SPV established by the Federal Reserve for this facility. Under the TALF, the Federal Reserve will lend on a non-recourse basis to holders of certain AAA-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated consumer and small business loans. The Federal Reserve will lend an amount equal to the market value of the ABS less a haircut and will be secured at all times by the ABS. Treasury, using the ESF, will also make an equity investment in the SPV established by the Federal Reserve for this facility. The TALF, PMCCF and SMCCF are established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Treasury Secretary. These actions augment the measures taken by the Federal Reserve over the past week to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. These include:  The establishment of the CPFF, the MMLF, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility; The expansion of central bank liquidity swap lines; Steps to enhance the availability and ease terms for borrowing at the discount window; The elimination of reserve requirements; Guidance encouraging banks to be flexible with customers experiencing financial challenges related to the coronavirus and to utilize their liquidity and capital buffers in doing so; Statements encouraging the use of daylight credit at the Federal Reserve.  Taken together, these actions will provide support to a wide range of markets and institutions, thereby supporting the flow of credit in the economy.

In particular:  The Federal Reserve will focus on monitoring and outreach to help financial institutions of all sizes understand the challenges and risks of the current environment; To minimize disruption and to focus on outreach and monitoring, the Federal Reserve will temporarily reduce its examination activities, with the greatest reduction in activities occurring at the smallest banks; Large banks should still submit their capital plans that they have developed as part of the Board's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, by April 6. The plans will be used to monitor how firms are managing their capital in the current environment; and To allow firms to focus on heightened risks in this current environment and assist consumers, additional time will be granted for resolving non-critical existing supervisory findings.

The statement of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recognizes that responsible small-dollar loans can play an important role in meeting customers' credit needs because of temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income disruptions during periods of economic stress or disaster recoveries. Such loans can be offered through a variety of structures including open-end lines of credit, closed-end installment loans, or appropriately structured single payment loans. The agencies state that loans should be offered in a manner that provides fair treatment of consumers, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and is consistent with safe and sound practices. For borrowers who experience unexpected circumstances and cannot repay a loan as structured, banks, savings associations and credit unions are further encouraged to consider workout strategies designed to help borrowers to repay the principal of the loan while mitigating the need to re-borrow. This statement follows other actions taken by the agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the financial services needs of their customers and members who have been affected by COVID-19. For example, the federal banking agencies issued a joint statement on March 19 informing institutions that the agencies will favorably consider retail banking and lending activities that meet the needs of affected low- and moderate-income individuals, small businesses, and small farms for Community Reinvestment Act purposes, that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and applicable laws, including consumer protection laws. In addition to today's statement, the agencies are working on future guidance and lending principles for responsible small-dollar loans to facilitate the ability of banks, credit unions, and saving associations to more effectively meet the ongoing credit needs of their customers, members, and communities.

The ""standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk"" rule, also known as SA-CCR, was finalized by the agencies in November 2019, with an effective date of April 1. It reflects improvements made to the derivatives market since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, such as central clearing and margin requirements. To help improve current market liquidity and smooth disruptions, the agencies will permit banking organizations to early adopt SA-CCR for the reporting period ending March 31. Additionally, the agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the ""current expected credit loss,"" or CECL, accounting standard in their regulatory capital. Banking organizations that are required under U.S. accounting standards to adopt CECL this year can mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects for up to two years. This is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place. Alternatively, banking organizations can follow the capital transition rule issued by the banking agencies in February 2019. The changes will be effective immediately and the agencies will accept comments on the CECL interim final rule for 45 days.

The FIMA Repo Facility will allow FIMA account holders, which consist of central banks and other international monetary authorities with accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to enter into repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve. In these transactions, FIMA account holders temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. It should also serve, along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Reserve has established with other central banks, to help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets. The Federal Reserve provides U.S. dollar-denominated banking services to FIMA account holders in support of Federal Reserve objectives and in recognition of the U.S. dollar's predominant role as an international currency. The FIMA Repo Facility, which adds to the range of services the Federal Reserve provides, will be available beginning April 6 and will continue for at least 6 months.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200401a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces temporary change to its supplementary leverage ratio rule to ease strains in the Treasury market resulting from the coronavirus and increase banking organizationsâ ability to provide credit to households and businesses,,2020.0,"To ease strains in the Treasury market resulting from the coronavirus and increase banking organizations' ability to provide credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced a temporary change to its supplementary leverage ratio rule. The change would exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the rule for holding companies, and will be in effect until March 31, 2021. Liquidity conditions in Treasury markets have deteriorated rapidly, and financial institutions are receiving significant inflows of customer deposits along with increased reserve levels. The regulatory restrictions that accompany this balance sheet growth may constrain the firms' ability to continue to serve as financial intermediaries and to provide credit to households and businesses. The change to the supplementary leverage ratio will mitigate the effects of those restrictions and better enable firms to support the economy. As the Board has previously stated, financial institutions have more than doubled their capital and liquidity levels over the past decade and are encouraged to use that strength to support households and businesses. The Board is providing the temporary exclusion in the interim final rule to allow banking organizations to expand their balance sheets as appropriate to continue to serve as financial intermediaries, rather than to allow banking organizations to increase capital distributions, and will administer the interim final rule accordingly. The supplementary leverage ratio generally applies to financial institutions with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. It requires them to hold a minimum ratio of 3 percent, measured against their total leverage exposure, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most systemic financial institutions. The change would temporarily decrease tier 1 capital requirements of holding companies by approximately 2 percent in aggregate. The change will be effective immediately and the public comment period will be 45 days. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200403a.htm,Federal agencies encourage mortgage servicers to work with struggling homeowners affected by COVID-19,,2020.0,"The federal financial institution regulatory agencies and the state financial regulators issued a joint policy statement providing needed regulatory flexibility to enable mortgage servicers to work with struggling consumers affected by the Coronavirus Disease (referred to as COVID-19) emergency. The actions announced today by the agencies inform servicers of the agencies' flexible supervisory and enforcement approach during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding certain communications to consumers required by the mortgage servicing rules. The policy statement and guidance issued today will facilitate mortgage servicers' ability to place consumers in short-term payment forbearance programs such as the one established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Under the CARES Act, borrowers in a federally backed mortgage loan experiencing a financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic, may request forbearance by making a request to their mortgage servicer and affirming that they are experiencing a financial hardship during the COVIDâ19 pandemic. In response, servicers must provide a CARES Act forbearance, that allows borrowers to defer their mortgage payments for up to 180-days and possibly longer. The policy statement clarifies that the agencies do not intend to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in sending certain early intervention and loss mitigation notices and taking certain actions relating to loss mitigation set out in the mortgage servicing rules, provided that servicers are making good faith efforts to provide these notices and take these actions within a reasonable time. To further enable short-term payment forbearance programs or short-term repayment plans, mortgage servicers offering these programs or plans will not have to provide an acknowledgement notice within 5 days of receipt of an incomplete application, provided the servicer sends the acknowledgment notice before the end of the forbearance or repayment period. The guidance also reminds servicers that there is existing flexibility in the rules with respect to the content of certain notices. Finally, to assist servicers experiencing high call volumes from consumers seeking help, the policy statement also confirms that the agencies do not intend to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in sending annual escrow statements, provided that servicers are making good faith efforts to provide these statements within a reasonable time.

The agencies are acting to implement Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which requires the agencies to temporarily lower the community bank leverage ratio to 8 percent. The two rules will modify the community bank leverage ratio framework so that:  Beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of the year, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8 percent or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework; and Community banking organizations will have until January 1, 2022, before the community bank leverage ratio requirement is re-established at greater than 9 percent.  Under the interim final rules, the community bank leverage ratio will be 8 percent beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5 percent for calendar year 2021, and 9 percent thereafter. The interim final rules also maintain a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 1 percent below the applicable community bank leverage ratio. The agencies are providing community banking organizations with a clear and gradual transition back to the 9 percent leverage ratio requirement previously established by the agencies. This transition will allow community banking organizations to focus on supporting lending to creditworthy households and businesses given the recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by the coronavirus.

The revised statement also provides the agencies' views on consumer protection considerations. The revised statement clarifies the interaction between the interagency statement issued on March 22, 2020, and the temporary relief provided by Section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 allows financial institutions to suspend the requirements to classify certain loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The revised statement also provides supervisory interpretations on past due and nonaccrual regulatory reporting of loan modification programs and regulatory capital. The agencies encourage financial institutions to work with borrowers and will not criticize institutions for doing so in a safe and sound manner. The agencies view prudent loan modification programs offered to financial institution customers affected by COVID-19 as positive and proactive actions that can manage or mitigate adverse impacts on borrowers, and lead to improved loan performance and reduced credit risk. The agencies' examiners will exercise judgment in reviewing loan modifications, including TDRs, and will not automatically adversely risk-rate credits that are affected by COVID-19, including those considered TDRs.

The change will only allow the firm to make additional small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, and the Federal Reserve's forthcoming Main Street Lending Program. The Board will require benefits from the PPP and the Main Street Lending Program to be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-profit organizations approved by the Federal Reserve that support small businesses. The change will be in place as long as the facilities are active. The Board's growth restriction was implemented because of widespread compliance and operational breakdowns that resulted in harm to consumers and because the company's activities were ineffectively overseen by its board of directors. The growth restriction does not prevent the firm from engaging in any type of activity, including the PPP, the Main Street Lending Program, or accepting customer deposits. Rather, it provides an overall cap on the size of the firm's balance sheet. The change today provides additional support to small businesses hurt by the economic effects of the coronavirus by allowing activities from the PPP and the Main Street Lending Program to not count against the cap. The changes do not otherwise modify the Board's February 2018 enforcement action against Wells Fargo.

This funding will assist households and employers of all sizes and bolster the ability of state and local governments to deliver critical services during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Our country's highest priority must be to address this public health crisis, providing care for the ill and limiting the further spread of the virus,"" said Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell. ""The Fed's role is to provide as much relief and stability as we can during this period of constrained economic activity, and our actions today will help ensure that the eventual recovery is as vigorous as possible."" The Federal Reserve's role is guided by its mandate from Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices, along with its responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. In support of these goals, the Federal Reserve is using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit in the economy. The actions the Federal Reserve is taking today to support employers of all sizes and communities across the country will:  Bolster the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by supplying liquidity to participating financial institutions through term financing backed by PPP loans to small businesses. The PPP provides loans to small businesses so that they can keep their workers on the payroll. The Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) will extend credit to eligible financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value; Ensure credit flows to small and mid-sized businesses with the purchase of up to $600 billion in loans through the Main Street Lending Program. The Department of the Treasury, using funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) will provide $75 billion in equity to the facility; Increase the flow of credit to households and businesses through capital markets, by expanding the size and scope of the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities (PMCCF and SMCCF) as well as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). These three programs will now support up to $850 billion in credit backed by $85 billion in credit protection provided by the Treasury; and Help state and local governments manage cash flow stresses caused by the coronavirus pandemic by establishing a Municipal Liquidity Facility that will offer up to $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities. The Treasury will provide $35 billion of credit protection to the Federal Reserve for the Municipal Liquidity Facility using funds appropriated by the CARES Act.  The Main Street Lending Program will enhance support for small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the crisis by offering 4-year loans to companies employing up to 10,000 workers or with revenues of less than $2.5 billion. Principal and interest payments will be deferred for one year. Eligible banks may originate new Main Street loans or use Main Street loans to increase the size of existing loans to businesses. Banks will retain a 5 percent share, selling the remaining 95 percent to the Main Street facility, which will purchase up to $600 billion of loans. Firms seeking Main Street loans must commit to make reasonable efforts to maintain payroll and retain workers. Borrowers must also follow compensation, stock repurchase, and dividend restrictions that apply to direct loan programs under the CARES Act. Firms that have taken advantage of the PPP may also take out Main Street loans. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury recognize that businesses vary widely in their financing needs, particularly at this time, and, as the program is being finalized, will continue to seek input from lenders, borrowers, and other stakeholders to make sure the program supports the economy as effectively and efficiently as possible while also safeguarding taxpayer funds. Comments may be sent to the feedback form until April 16. To support further credit flow to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will broaden the range of assets that are eligible collateral for TALF. As detailed in an updated term sheet, TALF-eligible collateral will now include the triple-A rated tranches of both outstanding commercial mortgage-backed securities and newly issued collateralized loan obligations. The size of the facility will remain $100 billion, and TALF will continue to support the issuance of asset-backed securities that fund a wide range of lending, including student loans, auto loans, and credit card loans. The Municipal Liquidity Facility will help state and local governments better manage cash flow pressures in order to continue to serve households and businesses in their communities. The facility will purchase up to $500 billion of short term notes directly from U.S. states (including the District of Columbia), U.S. counties with a population of at least two million residents, and U.S. cities with a population of at least one million residents. Eligible state-level issuers may use the proceeds to support additional counties and cities. In addition to the actions described above, the Federal Reserve will continue to closely monitor conditions in the primary and secondary markets for municipal securities and will evaluate whether additional measures are needed to support the flow of credit and liquidity to state and local governments. All of the facilities mentioned above are established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Treasury Secretary. The Federal Reserve remains committed to using its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.

The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are providing this temporary relief to allow regulated institutions to extend financing to creditworthy households and businesses quickly in the wake of the national emergency declared in connection with COVID-19. The agencies are deferring certain appraisals and evaluations for up to 120 days after closing of residential or commercial real estate loan transactions. Transactions involving acquisition, development, and construction of real estate are excluded from this interim rule. These temporary provisions will expire on December 31, 2020, unless extended by the federal banking agencies. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) will consider a similar proposal on Thursday, April 16. In addition, the federal banking agencies, together with NCUA and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, issued a joint statement to address challenges relating to appraisals and evaluations for real estate-related financial transactions affected by COVID-19. The interagency statement outlines other flexibilities in industry appraisal standards and in the agencies' appraisal regulations and describes temporary changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac appraisal standards that can assist lenders during this challenging time.

The change will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply for PPP loans for their small businesses. To prevent favoritism, Board rules limit the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their related banks. These requirements have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loansâespecially in rural areas. The SBA recently clarified that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits and without favoritism. The Board's change will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The change only applies to PPP loans. The Board is providing the temporary change to allow banks to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from favoring in processing time or prioritization a PPP loan application from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer its rule change accordingly. The rule change is effective immediately and will be in place while the PPP is active. Comments will be accepted for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Specifically, the Board will report substantial amounts of information on a monthly basis for the liquidity and lending facilities using Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act funding, including the:  Names and details of participants in each facility; Amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and Overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility.  ""The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability by providing the public and Congress detailed information about our actions to support the economy during this difficult time,"" Chair Jerome H.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200423a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces temporary actions aimed at increasing the availability of intraday credit extended by Federal Reserve Banks,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced temporary actions aimed at increasing the availability of intraday credit extended by Federal Reserve Banks on both a collateralized and uncollateralized basis. These temporary actions are consistent with the series of actions the Board has announced to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and to mitigate the disruptions from COVID-19.1 In particular, these actions are consistent with and indeed reinforce the Board's efforts to encourage regular use of intraday credit by healthy financial institutions. In light of disruptions from COVID-19, depository institutions may face unanticipated intraday liquidity constraints and demands on collateral pledged to the Reserve Banks. In response, the Board is adjusting the manner in which the Reserve Banks administer part II of the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk (PSR policy). Specifically, the Board is (1) suspending uncollateralized intraday credit limits (net debit caps) and is waiving overdraft fees for institutions that are eligible for the primary credit program; and (2) permitting a streamlined procedure for secondary credit institutions to request collateralized intraday credit (max caps). Relatedly, the Board is suspending two collections of information that are used to calculate net debit caps. The Board believes that these actions will not meaningfully increase credit risk to Reserve Banks. These temporary actions will be applied immediately and will remain in effect until September 30, 2020, unless the Board communicates otherwise prior to that date.

The facility, which was announced on April 9 as part of an initiative to provide up to $2.3 trillion in loans to support U.S. households, businesses, and communities, will offer up to $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities to help manage cash flow stresses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The facility, as revised, will purchase up to $500 billion of short-term notes issued by U.S. states (including the District of Columbia), U.S. counties with a population of at least 500,000 residents, and U.S. cities with a population of at least 250,000 residents. The new population thresholds allow substantially more entities to borrow directly from the MLF than the initial plan announced on April 9. The facility continues to provide for states, cities, and counties to use the proceeds of notes purchased by the MLF to purchase similar notes issued by, or otherwise to assist, other political subdivisions and governmental entities. The expansion announced today also allows participation in the facility by certain multistate entities. To be eligible for the facility, notes must mature no later than 36 months from the date of issuanceâan increase from the previously announced 24-month maximum term. In addition, among other rating requirements, eligible issuers must have had an investment grade rating as of April 8, 2020, from at least two major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The termination date for the facility has been extended to December 31, 2020 in order to provide eligible issuers more time and flexibility. The Federal Reserve is also considering expanding the MLF to allow a limited number of governmental entities that issue bonds backed by their own revenue to participate directly in the MLF as eligible issuers. Any decision to include any such additional eligible issuers would be publicly announced at a future date. The Federal Reserve will continue to closely monitor conditions in primary and secondary markets for municipal securities and will evaluate whether additional measures are needed to support the flow of credit and liquidity to state and local governments. The MLF is established under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Treasury Secretary. The Treasury will provide $35 billion of credit protection to the Federal Reserve for the facility using funds appropriated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The Federal Reserve remains committed to using its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200430a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces it is expanding the scope and eligibility for the Main Street Lending Program,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced it is expanding the scope and eligibility for the Main Street Lending Program. As part of its broad effort to support the economy, the Federal Reserve developed the Main Street Lending Program to help credit flow to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the pandemic. When the initial terms of Main Street were announced, the Board indicated that, because the financial needs of businesses vary widely, it was seeking feedback from the public on potential refinements. More than 2,200 letters from individuals, businesses, and nonprofits were received. In response to the public input, the Board decided to expand the loan options available to businesses, and increased the maximum size of businesses that are eligible for support under the program. The changes include:  Creating a third loan option, with increased risk sharing by lenders for borrowers with greater leverage; Lowering the minimum loan size for certain loans to $500,000; and Expanding the pool of businesses eligible to borrow.  Under the new loan option, lenders would retain a 15 percent share on loans that when added to existing debt do not exceed six times a borrower's income, adjusted for interest payments, taxes, and depreciation and other appropriate adjustments. This compares to the existing loan options where lenders retain a 5 percent share on loans, but have different features. Under all of the loan options, lenders will be able to apply their industry-specific expertise and underwriting standards to best measure a borrower's income. In total, three loan optionsâtermed new, priority, and expandedâwill be available for businesses. The chart below summarizes the different loan options. Additionally, businesses with up to 15,000 employees or up to $5 billion in annual revenue are now eligible, compared to the initial program terms, which were for companies with up to 10,000 employees and $2.5 billion in revenue. The minimum loan size for two of the options was also lowered to $500,000 from $1 million. With the changes, the program will now offer more options to a wider set of eligible small and medium-size businesses. The Board recognizes the critical role that nonprofit organizations play throughout the economy and is evaluating a separate approach to meet their unique needs. The Main Street Lending Program was established under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Treasury Secretary. The Treasury will provide $75 billion for the program using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Frequently asked questions and answers for lenders and borrowers are also available. A start date for the program will be announced soon.

The statement will promote consistency in the interpretation and application of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's credit losses accounting standard, which introduces the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The interagency policy statement describes the measurement of expected credit losses using the CECL methodology and updates concepts and practices detailed in existing supervisory guidance that remain applicable. The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued the interagency policy statement, which will be effective at the time of each institution's adoption of the credit losses accounting standard. The agencies also finalized interagency guidance on credit risk review systems. The guidance presents principles for establishing a system of independent, ongoing credit risk review in accordance with safety and soundness standards.

Financial circumstances were generally positive for most adults at the end of 2019. However, the Federal Reserve Board's latest Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020, found that financial conditions changed dramatically for people who experienced job loss or reduced hours during March 2020 as the spread of COVID-19 intensified in the United States. The report draws from the Board's seventh annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which examines the economic well-being and financial lives of U.S. adults and their families. The 2019 survey of over 12,000 adults was conducted in October of last year, offering a picture of personal finances prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To obtain updated information in the midst of closures and stay-at-home orders, a smaller supplemental survey of just over 1,000 adults was conducted from April 3 to April 6 of this year, focusing on labor market effects and households' overall financial circumstances at that time. In April 2020, fewer adults reported that they were at least doing okay financially than had been the case 6 months earlier. The April supplemental survey showed that 72 percent of adults were either ""doing okay"" financially (43 percent) or ""living comfortably"" (29 percent). This is down from the 75 percent of adults who were at least doing okay financially and the 36 percent who were living comfortably in the fall of 2019. ""A clearer understanding of how families are coping with the changed economic landscape is vital as the Federal Reserve considers next steps to address fallout from the pandemic,"" said Governor Michelle W. Bowman. ""The survey data show that early in the public health crisis, a larger fraction of Americans were facing financial hardship than in the fall of 2019."" The declines in self-reported financial well-being were concentrated among those who lost a job or had their work hours cut. Among adults not experiencing a job loss or reduction in hours, 76 percent were at least okay financially in April, which is similar to the overall share of adults who reported being at least okay financially in the fall. Among those who experienced a job loss or hours reduction, however, 51 percent indicated that they were doing at least okay financially in April, whereas 48 percent were ""finding it difficult to get by"" or ""just getting by."" Thirteen percent of adults, representing 20 percent of people who had been working in February, reported that they lost a job or were furloughed in March or the beginning of April 2020. Another 6 percent of all adults saw their hours reduced or took unpaid leave. Taken together, 19 percent of all adults reported either losing a job or experiencing a reduction in work hours in March. Despite these widespread employment losses, some people took on new or additional employment in March. Seven percent of adults reported that they increased their hours worked or worked overtime. Many people who lost a job remained connected to their employer and expected to return to the same job eventually. Nine in 10 people who were furloughed or lost a job said that their employer indicated that they would return to their job at some point. In general, however, people were not told specifically when to expect to return to work. Seventy-seven percent said that their employer told them to expect to return, but did not give them a return date. Consistent with the employment declines in March, many people experienced income declines. Twenty-three percent of all adults, and 70 percent of those who lost a job or had their hours reduced, said their income in March was lower than in February. Income losses can affect people's ability to pay regular monthly bills. Eighty-one percent of adults said they could pay all the current month's bills in full in April, compared to 84 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. Yet, the survey found far greater rates of difficulty among those experiencing employment disruptions. Sixty-four percent of adults who reported a job loss or reduction in hours expected to be able to pay all their bills in full in April, compared to 85 percent of those without an employment disruption. In addition to monitoring how households were faring near the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report also highlights continuing financial concerns for many households that predated the public health crisis. Some of these financial challenges include the 25 percent of non-retired adults who lack retirement savings, the 18 percent of adults with outstanding debt from medical treatments, and the 3 percent of people who do not own their home who experienced an eviction in 2018 or 2019. Three in 10 adults in 2019 said they could not cover three months of expenses using their savings or borrowing in the case of a job loss, indicating that they were not prepared for the current financial challenges. Results from the full survey reflect financial conditions in late 2019 before the pandemic's onset, and results from the supplemental survey reflect financial conditions at the beginning of April 2020 and indicate the nature of families' experiences of financial conditions at that time. However, the financial repercussions from COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the Federal Reserve Board will continue to monitor the financial conditions of households.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200515a.htm,Regulators temporarily change the supplementary leverage ratio to increase banking organizations' ability to support credit to households and businesses in light of the coronavirus response,,2020.0,"The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced temporary changes to their supplementary leverage ratio rule. The temporary modifications will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response. Issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the interim final rule permits depository institutions to choose to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. If a depository institution does change its supplementary leverage ratio calculation, it will be required to request approval from its primary federal banking regulator before making capital distributions, such as paying dividends to its parent company, as long as the exclusion is in effect. The agencies are providing this temporary exclusion to enable depository institutions to expand their balance sheets as appropriate to serve as financial intermediaries and serve their customers. The supplementary leverage ratio generally includes subsidiaries of bank holding companies with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. The rule requires them to hold a minimum ratio of 3 percent, measured against their total leverage exposure, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most systemic financial institutions. The change will be effective once the rule is published in the Federal Register and will be in effect through March 31, 2021. Comments will be accepted for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register. The Board today also asked for feedback on additional questions relating to the interim final rule.

These ratios replace the prior year's ratios, which were released on May 28, 2019. In general, section 109 prohibits a bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 also prohibits branches of banks controlled by out-of-state bank holding companies from operating primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Section 109 provides a process to test compliance with the statutory requirements. The first step in the process involves a loan-to-deposit ratio test that compares a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio to the host state loan-to-deposit ratio for banks in a particular state. A second step is conducted if a bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than one-half of the published ratio for that state or if data are not available at the bank to conduct the first step. The second step requires the appropriate agency to determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank's interstate branches. A bank that fails both steps is in violation of section 109 and is subject to sanctions by the appropriate agency. The updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios are attached.

The Board lowered the minimum loan amount, raised the maximum loan limit, adjusted the principal repayment schedule to begin after two years, and extended the term to five years, providing borrowers with greater flexibility in repaying the loans. The Board expects the Main Street program to be open for lender registration soon and to be actively buying loans shortly afterwards. ""Supporting small and mid-sized businesses so they are ready to reopen and rehire workers will help foster a broad-based economic recovery,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said. ""I am confident the changes we are making will improve the ability of the Main Street Lending Program to support employment during this difficult period."" Small and medium-sized businesses are a vital part of the economy and employ tens of millions of people, and, because their needs vary widely, the Board has extensively sought feedback and revised the Main Street program accordingly. The changes include:  Lowering the minimum loan size for certain loans to $250,000 from $500,000; Increasing the maximum loan size for all facilities; Increasing the term of each loan option to five years, from four years; Extending the repayment period for all loans by delaying principal payments for two years, rather than one; and Raising the Reserve Bank's participation to 95% for all loans.  The chart below has additional details on the changes. Once they have successfully registered for the program, lenders are encouraged to begin making Main Street loans immediately. The Main Street Lending Program intends to purchase 95% of each eligible loan that is submitted to the program, provided that the required documentation is complete and the transactions are consistent with the relevant Main Street facility's requirements. The Main Street Lending Program will also accept loans that were originated under the previously announced terms, if funded before June 10, 2020. Nonprofit organizations play a critical role throughout the economy, and the Board is working to establish a program soon for these organizations.

As with the existing Main Street Lending Program, which targets small and medium-sized businesses, the proposed expansion would offer loans to small and medium-sized nonprofits that were in sound financial condition before the coronavirus pandemic and could benefit from additional liquidity to manage through this challenging period. ""Nonprofit organizations are critical parts of our economy, employing millions of people, providing essential services to communities, and supporting innovation and the development of a highly skilled workforce,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said. ""Nonprofits provide vital services across the country and we are working to help them through this difficult time."" Loan terms under the proposed Main Street nonprofit loans, including the interest rate, deferral of principal and interest payments, and five-year term, are the same as for Main Street business loans. The minimum loan size is $250,000 while the maximum loan size is $300 million. Principal payments would be fully deferred for the first two years of the loan, and interest payments would be deferred for one year. Two loan options would be offered under the proposal. Borrower eligibility requirements for the proposed nonprofit facilities would be modified from the for-profit facilities to reflect the operational and accounting practices of the nonprofit sector and include:  Minimum of 50 and maximum of 15,000 employees; Financial thresholds based on operating performance, liquidity, and ability to repay debt; An operational history of at least five years; and A limit on endowments of no more than $3 billion.  Additionally, each organization must be a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. The chart below has additional details on the proposed terms. Because the circumstances, structure, and needs of nonprofit organizations vary widely, public feedback is being sought to help make the proposed program as efficient and effective as possible. Feedback may be submitted via email here until Monday, June 22. Feedback will be made available to the public, and comments should not include confidential information.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200618a.htm,Federal Reserve announces FraudClassifier Model to help organizations classify fraud involving payments,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve today published the FraudClassifier modelâa set of tools and materials to help provide a consistent way to classify and better understand the magnitude of fraudulent activity and how it occurs across the payments industry. The model was developed by the Fraud Definitions Work Group, which was comprised of Federal Reserve and payments industry fraud experts. ""The FraudClassifier model can help address the industrywide challenge of inconsistent classifications for fraud involving ACH, wire, or check payments,"" said Jim Cunha, secure payments strategy leader and senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ""The FraudClassifier model enables payments stakeholders to classify fraud in a simple and similar manner. It can be applied across an organization to help ensure greater internal consistency in fraud classification, more robust information and better fraud tracking."" The key advantage of the FraudClassifier model is the ability for organizations to use it to classify fraud independently of payment type, payment channel or other payment characteristics. The model presents a series of questions, beginning with who initiated the payment to differentiate payments initiated by authorized or unauthorized parties. Each of the classifications is supported by definitions that allow for consistent application of the FraudClassifier model across the industry. The Fraud Definitions Work Group also developed and recommended an industry adoption roadmap, which outlines a strategy and potential steps to encourage voluntary industrywide use of the FraudClassifier model.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200625b.htm,Agencies finalize amendments to swap margin rule ,,2020.0,"Five federal agencies have finalized changes to their swap margin rule to facilitate the implementation of prudent risk management strategies at banks and other entities with significant swap activities. Under the final rule, entities that are part of the same banking organization generally will no longer be required to hold a specific amount of initial margin for uncleared swaps with each other, known as inter-affiliate swaps. Inter-affiliate swaps typically are used for internal risk management purposes by transferring risk to a centralized risk management function within the firm. The final rule will give firms additional flexibility to allocate collateral internally and support prudent risk management and safety and soundness. Inter-affiliate swaps will remain subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margin will still be required if a depository institution's total exposure to all affiliates exceeds 15 percent of its Tier 1 capital. To help transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, the final rule allows swap entities to amend legacy swaps to replace the reference to LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to end without triggering margin exchange requirements. The final rule also clarifies that swap entities may conduct risk-reducing portfolio compression or make certain other non-substantive amendments to their legacy swap portfolios without altering their legacy status. For smaller swap market participants, the agencies are finalizing as proposed the additional phased compliance period for the smallest covered swap entities and financial end-user counterparties. Simultaneously, the agencies are requesting comment on an interim final rule that extends the compliance date of the initial margin requirements of the swap margin rules to September 1, 2021, for swap entities and counterparties with average annual notional swap portfolios of $50 billion to $750 billion. This interim final rule also extends the initial margin compliance date to September 1, 2022, for counterparties with average annual notional swap portfolios of $8 billion to $50 billion. The final rule provides additional clarification on documentation requirements for smaller counterparties. Comments on the interim final rule will be accepted for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.

The final rule is broadly similar to the proposed rule from January. The Volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200625c.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases results of stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses conducted in light of the coronavirus event,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released the results of its stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses that the Board conducted in light of the coronavirus event. ""The banking system has been a source of strength during this crisis,"" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said, ""and the results of our sensitivity analyses show that our banks can remain strong in the face of even the harshest shocks."" In addition to its normal stress test, the Board conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resiliency of large banks under three hypothetical recessions, or downside scenarios, which could result from the coronavirus event. The scenarios included a V-shaped recession and recovery; a slower, U-shaped recession and recovery; and a W-shaped, double-dip recession. In the three downside scenarios, the unemployment rate peaked at between 15.6 percent and 19.5 percent, which is significantly more stringent than any of the Board's pre-coronavirus stress test scenarios. The scenarios are not predictions or forecasts of the likely path of the economy or financial markets. In aggregate, loan losses for the 34 banks ranged from $560 billion to $700 billion in the sensitivity analysis and aggregate capital ratios declined from 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to between 9.5 percent and 7.7 percent under the hypothetical downside scenarios. Under the U- and W-shaped scenarios, most firms remain well capitalized but several would approach minimum capital levels. The sensitivity analysis does not incorporate the potential effects of government stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance. In light of these results, the Board took several actions following its stress tests to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the coronavirus event. For the third quarter of this year, the Board is requiring large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income. The Board is also requiring banks to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans. All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect current stresses, which will help firms re-assess their capital needs and maintain strong capital planning practices during this period of uncertainty. The Board will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if adjustments to this response are appropriate. During the third quarter, no share repurchases will be permitted. In recent years, share repurchases have represented approximately 70 percent of shareholder payouts from large banks. The Board is also capping dividend payments to the amount paid in the second quarter and is further limiting them to an amount based on recent earnings. As a result, a bank cannot increase its dividend and can pay dividends if it has earned sufficient income. The Board also released the results of its full stress test designed before the coronavirus. The results from that test are comparable to the V-shaped downside scenario in the sensitivity analysis, in aggregate, and show that all large banks remain strongly capitalized. The Board will use the results of this test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms, which will take effect, as planned, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Board will not be objecting to five foreign banks whose capital planning practices were evaluated as part of the stress tests. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

The Interagency Questions and Answers, which provide information addressing technical flood insurance-related compliance issues, were last updated in 2011.  The agencies are proposing new questions and answers for inclusion in the Interagency Questions and Answers in light of changes to flood insurance requirements under the agencies' joint rule regarding loans in special flood hazard areas. This rule was promulgated in 2015 to implement provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014. The proposal incorporates new questions and answers in several areas, including:  The escrow of flood insurance premiums; The detached structure exemption to the mandatory purchase of flood insurance requirement; and Force-placement procedures.  The proposal also revises existing questions and answers to improve clarity and reorganizes questions and answers by topic to make it easier for users to find and review information related to technical flood insurance topics. The proposal is intended to help reduce the compliance burden for lenders related to the federal flood insurance laws. Separately, the agencies plan to propose new questions and answers at a later date on the private flood insurance requirements implemented by their February 2019 final rule.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200715a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces extension of rule change to bolster effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced an extension of a rule change to bolster the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Like the earlier rule, the extension will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply to their banks for PPP loans for their small businesses. To prevent favoritism, the Board limits the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their affiliated banks. However, these limits have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loansâespecially in rural areas. The SBA clarified in April that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits, and without favoritism. The Board's rule change will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The change only applies to PPP loans. The Board is providing the temporary change to allow banks to continue to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from favoring in processing time or prioritization a PPP loan application from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer its rule change accordingly. The rule change is effective immediately and will be in place while the PPP is active. Comments will be accepted for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

As detailed in term sheets released today, the Board approved two new loan options to provide support to a broad set of nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition prior to the pandemic. ""Nonprofits provide vital services across the country and employ millions of Americans,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said. ""We have listened carefully and adapted our approach so that we can best support them in carrying out their vital mission during this extraordinary time."" Based on public feedback to proposals released for comment on June 15, the minimum employment threshold for nonprofits was lowered from 50 employees to 10, the limit on donation-based funding was eased, and several financial eligibility criteria were adjusted to accommodate a wider range of nonprofit operating models. Additionally, like the proposed terms, each organization must be a tax-exempt organization as described in section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Main Street nonprofit loan terms generally mirror those for Main Street for-profit business loans, including the interest rate, principal and interest payment deferral, five-year term, and minimum and maximum loan sizes. Nonprofits will be eligible for two loan options, and the chart below has additional details on the final terms. The Main Street Lending Program was established with the approval of the Treasury Secretary and with $75 billion in equity provided by the Treasury Department from the CARES Act.

The final rule is generally similar to the proposal from June 2019, with a few changes in response to public comments. The final rule updates the Board's FOIA regulation to be consistent with the Board's current practices and to incorporate recent changes in law and guidance. Some of these changes include updating definitions for expedited processing and the different categories of requesters. The revisions also clarify terms and help users more easily navigate the process of filing a FOIA request. The final rule provides clarifying revisions to the definition of CSI, and, like the proposal, does not expand or reduce the information that falls within the current definition of CSI. The final rule also updates certain outdated and inefficient restrictions governing the disclosure of CSI. For example, the final rule allows supervised financial institutions to share CSI with all affiliates, rather than only with their parent bank holding companies.

These facilities were established in March 2020 to ease strains in global dollar funding markets resulting from the COVID-19 shock and mitigate the effect of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad. The extensions of these facilities will help sustain recent improvements in global U.S. dollar funding markets by maintaining these important liquidity backstops. In addition, the FIMA repo facility will help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. The extension of the temporary swap lines applies to all nine central banks previously announced on March 19, 2020. These swap lines allow the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts up to $60 billion each for the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden). They allow the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts up to $30 billion each for the Danmarks Nationalbank (Denmark), the Norges Bank (Norway), and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The FIMA repo facility was originally announced on March 31, 2020. Its extension will allow approved FIMA account holders to continue to temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200810a.htm,"Federal Reserve Board announces individual large bank capital requirements, which will be effective on October 1",,2020.0,"Following its stress tests earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced individual large bank capital requirements, which will be effective on October 1. Under its framework for large banksâthose with more than $100 billion in total assetsâcapital requirements are in part determined by stress test results, which provide a risk-sensitive and forward-looking assessment of capital needs. The below table shows the total common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirements for each large bank, which is comprised of several components, including:  Minimum capital requirements, which are the same for each firm and are 4.5 percent; The stress capital buffer, or SCB, which is determined from the stress test results, and is at least 2.5 percent; and If applicable, a capital surcharge for global systemically important banks, or GSIBs, which is at least 1.0 percent.  Capital buffers, such as the SCB and GSIB surcharge, are different than minimum capital requirements for each firm. The Federal Reserve supports banking organizations that choose to use their capital buffers to lend to households and businesses and undertake other supportive actions in a safe and sound manner. When using their buffers, banking organizations may make capital distributions up to prescribed limits, which include automatic limitations in the capital framework, as well as any additional limitations determined by the Board. Also on Monday, the Board affirmed the stress test results for five firms that requested reconsideration. Those firms are BMO Financial Corporation, Capital One Financial Corporation, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Regions Financial Corporation. The reconsideration process involved an independent groupâseparate from the stress testing groupâthat analyzed and evaluated the results. The results were checked for errors and to ensure that the stress test models, which project the loan losses for banks, worked as intended and were consistent with the Board's stress test framework. As the Board has done with input gained from a variety of stakeholders and events, including its annual stress test model symposium, the Board will assess the information learned from the reconsideration process and use it to continue improving its stress testing methodology.

The initiatives complement a broad set of payments-related innovation projects currently underway within the Federal Reserve System. ""Given the dollar's important role, it is essential that the Federal Reserve remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding central bank digital currencies,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard. ""Like other central banks, we are continuing to assess the opportunities and challenges of, as well as the use cases for, a digital currency, as a complement to cash and other payments options."" Technological innovations inspire new ways to think about money. Consistent with its role in promoting a safe, accessible, and efficient U.S. payment system, the Federal Reserve is engaged in ongoing research and experimentation with the latest payment technologies. The Federal Reserve Board's Technology Lab (TechLab) is expanding experimentation with technologies relevant to digital currencies and other payment innovations. The TechLab conducts hands-on research to further the Federal Reserve's understanding of payment technologies and support development of policy views. The TechLab is a multidisciplinary team composed of Board and Federal Reserve Bank staff with expertise in payments, economics, law, information technology, and computer science. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is collaborating with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a multiyear effort to build a hypothetical digital currency oriented for central bank use. This research project is intended to support the Board's broader efforts in assessing the safety and efficiency of central bank digital currency systems. The project focuses solely on developing an understanding of the capacities and limitations of the relevant technologies, rather than serving as a prototype for a Federal Reserve issued digital currency or addressing the wide-ranging policy issues associated with its potential issuance. The Federal Reserve also continues its collaboration with other central banks and international organizations as it advances its understanding of central bank digital currencies.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200821a.htm,Agencies issue statement providing additional information for certain Bank Secrecy Act due diligence requirements,,2020.0,"WASHINGTONâThe Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today issued a joint statement clarifying that Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) due diligence requirements for customers who may be considered ""politically exposed persons"" (PEPs) should be commensurate with the risks posed by the PEP relationship. The term PEP is commonly used to refer to foreign individuals who are or have been entrusted with a prominent public function, as well as their immediate family members and close associates. By virtue of this public position or relationship, these individuals may present a higher risk that their funds may be the proceeds of corruption or other illicit activity. Addressing the money-laundering threat posed by corruption of foreign officials continues to be a national security priority for the United States. The statement recognizes that PEP relationships present varying levels of money-laundering risk, which depends on facts and circumstances specific to the customer relationship. For example, PEPs with a limited transaction volume, a low dollar deposit account with the bank, known legitimate sources of funds, or access only to products or services that are subject to specific terms and payment schedules could reasonably be characterized as having lower customer risk profiles. The statement clarifies that, while banks must adopt appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting customer due diligence (CDD), the CDD rule does not create a regulatory requirement, and there is no supervisory expectation for banks to have unique, additional due diligence steps for customers who are considered PEPs. This joint statement does not alter existing BSA and anti-money laundering (AML) legal or regulatory requirements and does not require banks to cease existing risk management practices.

They include:  A final rule that temporarily modifies the community bank leverage ratio, as required by the CARES Act; A final rule that makes more gradual, as intended, the automatic restrictions on distributions if a banking organization's capital levels decline below certain levels; and A final rule that allows institutions that adopt the current expected credit losses or ""CECL"" accounting standard in 2020 to mitigate the estimated effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years.  The final rule modifying the community bank leverage ratio adopts without change two interim final rules issued in April. The final rule temporarily lowers the community bank leverage ratio threshold and provides a gradual transition back to the prior level. Specifically, the threshold would be 8 percent for the remainder of this year, 8.5 percent for 2021, and 9 percent beginning January 1, 2022. This final rule is effective as of October 1, 2020. Similarly, the final rule on automatic restrictions of distributions adopts without change two interim final rules, one of which was Board-only, issued in March. The final rule makes more gradual, as intended, the automatic restrictions on capital distributions, such as share repurchases, dividend payments, and bonus payments. This final rule is effective as of January 1, 2021. Lastly, the CECL final rule is substantially similar to the interim final rule issued in March. The final rule gives eligible institutions the option to mitigate the estimated capital effects of CECL for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. Taken together, these measures offer institutions a transition period of up to five years. In a change from the interim rule, the final rule expands the pool of eligible institutions to include any institution adopting CECL in 2020. The CECL final rule is effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm,Federal Open Market Committee announces approval of updates to its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,,2020.0,"Following an extensive review that included numerous public events across the country, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Thursday announced the unanimous approval of updates to its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates its approach to monetary policy and serves as the foundation for its policy actions. The updates reflect changes in the economy over the past decade and how policymakers are taking these changes into account in conducting monetary policy. The updated statement is also intended to enhance the transparency, accountability and effectiveness of monetary policy. ""The economy is always evolving, and the FOMC's strategy for achieving its goals must adapt to meet the new challenges that arise,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. ""Our revised statement reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities, and that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation."" Among the more significant changes to the framework document are:  On maximum employment, the FOMC emphasized that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal and reports that its policy decision will be informed by its ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level."" The original document referred to ""deviations from its maximum level."" On price stability, the FOMC adjusted its strategy for achieving its longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent by noting that it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time."" To this end, the revised statement states that ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."" The updates to the strategy statement explicitly acknowledge the challenges for monetary policy posed by a persistently low interest rate environment. Here in the United States and around the world, monetary policy interest rates are more likely to be constrained by their effective lower-bound than in the past.  The Committee first adopted a framework statement in 2012. This first public review of the FOMC framework was announced by Chair Powell in November 2018, and involved three distinct components. First, the Federal Reserve hosted a series of 15 Fed Listens events across the country to engage with employee groups and union members, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income communities, retirees, and others to hear a wide range of perspectives about how monetary policy decisions affect their communities. A report summarizing all of those events is available here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens-report-20200612.pdf. Second, the Federal Reserve in June 2019 convened a research conference at which prominent academic experts addressed economic topics central to the review. That conference program, links to the conference papers and presentations, and links to session videos are available here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/conference-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-communications-20190605.htm. Finally, the Committee explored the range of issues that were brought to light during the course of the review in five consecutive meetings beginning in July 2019. Analytical staff work put together by teams across the Federal Reserve System provided essential background for the Committee's discussions. Minutes of those meetings are available here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm and a collection of those papers is available here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-system-analytical-work.htm. The FOMC reported it would continue its practice of considering the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy each January and that it intends to undertake a public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices roughly every 5 years.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200901b.htm,Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions affected by Hurricane Laura and California Wildfires,,2020.0,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the state regulators, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Laura and the California wildfires on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disasters. Lending: Financial institutions should work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Laura and the California wildfires. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Modifications of existing loans should be evaluated individually to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings. This evaluation should be based on the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, which requires judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructurings. In supervising institutions affected by these disasters, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Laura and the California wildfires. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by these disasters. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Laura and California wildfires may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Hurricane Laura and California wildfires that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of these disasters. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, institutions should review the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by Hurricane Laura and California wildfires. Institutions should monitor municipal securities and loans affected by these disasters. Appropriate monitoring and prudent efforts to stabilize such investments are encouraged.

The Board identified the error and all results affected by it, corrected those results, and implemented changes to prevent similar errors in the future. The loss rates for certain public welfare investments made by large banks were initially miscalculated, resulting in an overestimation of hypothetical losses for those investments. The error affected five banks: Citigroup Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo & Company. The resulting common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirements for three firms were unaffected, while the CET1 capital requirements for two firms were revised. The updated CET1 requirements for the five firms are listed in the table below. The related stress test results documents have also been updated. In its review of the loss models used for certain public welfare investments, the Board identified other model components that were similarly implemented and has conducted additional reviews, which found no further implementation errors.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200917a.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases hypothetical scenarios for second round of bank stress tests,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released its hypothetical scenarios for a second round of bank stress tests. Earlier this year, the Board's first round of stress tests found that large banks were well capitalized under a range of hypothetical events. An additional round of stress tests is being performed due to the continued uncertainty from the COVID event. Large banks will be tested against two scenarios featuring severe recessions to assess their resiliency under a range of outcomes. The Board will release firm-specific results from banks' performance under both scenarios by the end of this year. The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks are able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. The exercise evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their loan losses and capital levelsâwhich provide a cushion against lossesâunder hypothetical recession scenarios over nine quarters into the future. ""The Fed's stress tests earlier this year showed the strength of large banks under many different scenarios,"" Vice Chair Randal K. Quarles said. ""Although the economy has improved materially over the last quarter, uncertainty over the course of the next few quarters remains unusually high, and these two additional tests will provide more information on the resiliency of large banks."" The two hypothetical recessions in the scenarios feature severe global downturns with substantial stress in financial markets. The first scenarioâthe ""severely adverse""âfeatures the unemployment rate peaking at 12.5 percent at the end of 2021 and then declining to about 7.5 percent by the end of the scenario. Gross domestic product declines about 3 percent from the third quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2021. The scenario also features a sharp slowdown abroad.  The second scenarioâthe ""alternative severe""âfeatures an unemployment rate that peaks at 11 percent by the end of 2020 but stays elevated and only declines to 9 percent by the end of the scenario. Gross domestic product declines about 2.5 percent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2020. The chart below shows the path of the unemployment rate for each scenario. The two scenarios also include a global market shock component that will be applied to banks with large trading operations. Those banks, as well as certain banks with substantial processing operations, will also be required to incorporate the default of their largest counterparty. A table below shows the components that apply to each firm. The scenarios are not forecasts and are significantly more severe than most current baseline projections for the path of the U.S. economy under the stress testing period. They are designed to assess the strength of large banks during hypothetical recessions, which is especially appropriate in a period of uncertainty. Each scenario includes 28 variables covering domestic and international economic activity. In June, the Board released the results of its annual stress tests and additional analyses, which found that all large banks were sufficiently capitalized. Nonetheless, in light of the heightened economic uncertainty, the Board required banks to take several actions to preserve their capital levels in the third quarter of this year. The Board will announce by the end of September whether those measures to preserve capital will be extended into the fourth quarter.

The revised FAQs emphasize that lender underwriting should look back to the borrower's pre-pandemic condition and forward to their post-pandemic prospects. The FAQs also clarify supervisory expectations for lenders originating Main Street loans. The program supports lending to small and medium-sized for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the COVID-19 pandemic but lack access to credit on reasonable terms. The program offers several five-year loan options, with deferred principal and interest payments for qualified businesses and nonprofits to allow borrower's time to recover from the pandemic The revised FAQs were developed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston anticipates that the Main Street program will begin accepting loans made to multiple co-borrowers when that functionality is deployed next week.

Data collected to supplement the Federal Reserve Board's seventh annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking showed that U.S. families were faring better financially in July than in April, but many still faced uncertainty regarding layoffs and prospects for returning to work. Recognizing the unprecedented financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve conducted a pair of supplemental surveys to monitor changes in the financial well-being of Americans. The first of these surveys was conducted in April, at the onset of the pandemic and before most financial relief efforts were in place. The April results were described in the Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020. The second survey was conducted in July. In July, 77 percent of adults said they were doing at least okay financially, up from 72 percent in early April, and 75 percent in October 2019. This increase is likely due to some people returning to work as well as the availability of assistance programs either from the government or from charitable organizations. A substantial number of families received one or more forms of financial assistance, and the effects of these programs were apparent in people's overall financial well-being and ability to cover expenses. The July survey demonstrated that people appeared better able to handle small financial emergencies than they were nine months prior in October 2019. Seventy percent of adults said in July that they would be able to pay an unexpected $400 emergency expense entirely by using cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statementâan increase from 63 percent last October. While financial assistance programs provided some buffer from economic hardships and some people have returned to their jobs, many others remain out of work. Fourteen percent of all adults reported being laid off since the pandemic began. Among those laid off, 30 percent said in the July survey that they had returned to their former job, up from 5 percent in April. An additional 10 percent said they were working elsewhere and did not expect to return to their old job. Still, a larger share of laid-off workers expected the layoff to be permanent than in April. In July, 22 percent of adults who had been laid off said that they were not employed and that they did not expect to return to their old jobs. This is up from 7 percent of laid-off workers who reported in April that they were not employed and did not expect to return to their old jobs. The recent survey also shows that laid-off workers with low incomes are somewhat less likely to have returned to the same job. Twenty-five percent of laid-off workers with family incomes under $40,000 returned to the same job, compared with 39 percent of laid-off workers with family incomes over $100,000. Results from the April and July surveys reflect families' experiences of financial conditions over the initial months of the pandemic's onset. Yet, financial repercussions from COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the Federal Reserve Board plans to field the complete annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking in the fourth quarter of 2020 to continue to monitor the economic well-being of U.S. consumers in the months ahead.

The ANPR seeks feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities and address inequities in credit access. ""By releasing a thoughtful and balanced ANPR and providing a long period for comment, the Federal Reserve is hoping to build a foundation for the banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to CRA that has the broad support of the intended beneficiaries as well as banks of different sizes and business models,"" said Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell. ""The CRA is a seminal piece of legislation that remains as important as ever as the nation confronts challenges associated with racial equity and the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard. ""We must ensure that CRA continues to be a strong and effective tool to address systemic inequities in access to credit and financial services for LMI and minority individuals and communities."" Public comment on the ANPR will assist the Board in refining CRA modernization proposals to:  Strengthen CRA's core purpose of meeting the wide range of LMI banking needs and addressing inequities in financial services and credit access Address changes in the banking industry Promote financial inclusion by including special provisions for activities in Indian Country and underserved areas, and for investments in Minority Depository Institutions and Community Development Financial Institutions Bring greater clarity, consistency, and transparency to performance evaluations that are tailored to local conditions Tailor performance tests and assessments to account for differences in bank sizes and business models Clarify and expand eligible CRA activities focused on LMI communities Minimize data burden and tailor data collection and reporting requirements Recognize the special circumstances of small banks in rural areas Create a consistent regulatory approach  Congress enacted the CRA in 1977, as part of several landmark pieces of legislation enacted in the wake of the civil rights movement intended to address inequities in the credit markets. The Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have broad authority and responsibility for implementing the statute, which provides the agencies with a crucial mechanism for addressing persistent structural inequity in the financial system for LMI and minority individuals and communities. The statute and its implementing regulations also provide the agencies, regulated banks, and community organizations with necessary structure for facilitating and supporting a vital financial ecosystem that supports LMI- and minority-focused community development.

They include:  A final rule that temporarily defers appraisal and evaluation requirements for up to 120 days after the closing of certain residential and commercial real estate transactions; and A final rule that neutralizesâdue to the lack of credit and market riskâthe regulatory capital and liquidity effects for banks that participate in certain Federal Reserve liquidity facilities.  The final rule temporarily deferring appraisal and evaluation requirements is substantially similar to the interim final rule issued in April. It will allow individuals and businesses to more quickly access real estate equity to help address needs for liquidity as a result of the coronavirus. In response to comments, the final rule clarifies which loans are subject to the deferral. The final rule is effective upon publication in the Federal Register and will expire on December 31, 2020. The final rule pertaining to Federal Reserve liquidity facilities adopts without change three interim final rules issued in March, April, and May, 2020. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve launched several lending facilities to support the economy in light of the coronavirus response. The final rule neutralizes the regulatory capital and liquidity coverage ratio effects of participating in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility because there is no credit or market risk in association with exposures pledged to these facilities. As a result, the final rule will support the flow of credit to households and businesses affected by the coronavirus. The effective date of this final rule is 60 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register.

For the fourth quarter of this year, large banksâthose with more than $100 billion in total assetsâwill be prohibited from making share repurchases. Additionally, dividend payments will be capped and tied to a formula based on recent income. The capital positions of large banks have remained strong during the third quarter while such restrictions were in place. In June, the Board released the results of its annual stress test and additional analysis, which found that all large banks were sufficiently capitalized. Nonetheless, in light of the economic uncertainty, the Board put several restrictions in place to preserve bank capital, which provides a cushion against loan losses and supports lending. Later this year, the Board will conduct a second stress test to further test the resiliency of large banks. Results will be released by the end of the year.

Last year, the Board finalized a framework that sorts large banks into different categories based on their risks, with rules that are tailored to the risks of each category. The proposal today updates the Board's capital planning requirementsâwhich help ensure that firms plan for and determine their capital needs under a range of different scenariosâto reflect that new framework. In particular, firms in the lowest risk category are on a two-year stress test cycle and not subject to company-run stress test requirements and the proposal reflects those changes. The proposal also would seek comment on the Board's existing capital planning guidance applicable to all firms. The proposal would not change firms' capital requirements.

""Your participation is important to help us understand the size and structure of lenders like yours that supply credit or lease financing to U.S. households and businesses,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell in a letter to prospective census participants. ""The results will contribute to better-informed policy decisions and form the basis of our statistical releases, which have become all the more critical during the pandemic outbreak."" The assets and liabilities of finance companies have been surveyed by the Federal Reserve at roughly five-year intervals since 1955. The data collected provide a benchmark for the System's monthly report on the outstanding accounts receivable of finance companies (presented in the Federal Reserve's Finance Companies statistical release) and provide a comprehensive update on these companies' sources of funds. This information in turn becomes an important input to the estimates of total consumer credit (presented in the Federal Reserve's Consumer Credit statistical release) and the Financial Accounts of the United States. The attached letter from Chair Powell was sent to approximately 26,000 companies urging their participation in the census. Individual responses will be kept confidential.

The final rule is substantially similar to the proposal announced last year and complements other measures that the agencies have taken to limit interconnectedness among the largest banking organizations. U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies, or GSIBs, as well as U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign GSIBs, are required to issue debt with certain features under the Federal Reserve Board's ""total loss-absorbing capacity,"" or TLAC, rule. That debt could be used to recapitalize the holding company during bankruptcy or resolution if it were to fail. To discourage the largest banking organizations from purchasing TLAC debt, the final rule prescribes a more stringent regulatory capital treatment for holdings of TLAC debt. The regulatory capital treatment in the final rule will help to reduce the interconnectedness between the largest banking organizations and, if a GSIB were to fail, reduce the impact on the U.S. financial system from that failure. This rulemaking also includes a revision to the Federal Reserve Board's TLAC requirements that will require GSIBs to report publicly their outstanding TLAC debt.

The net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, final rule will require large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding, relative to each institution's assets, derivatives, and commitments. As a result, the NSFR rule will support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions by reducing liquidity risk and enhancing financial stability. The NSFR's requirements are tailored to the risks of large banks with the most stringent requirements applying to the largest and most complex firms and less stringent requirements applying to firms with less risk. The NSFR complements the agencies' liquidity coverage ratio rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is generally similar to the proposal from May 2016 and includes several changes based on further analysis and public input on the proposal. In particular, the calibration is now tailored to be consistent with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, and matches the tailored calibration of the LCR. Additionally, the funding requirements for certain assets were modified to better reflect their risks and support the stability of certain funding markets. The final rule is effective on July 1, 2021. Holding companies and any covered nonbank companies regulated by the Federal Reserve will be required to publicly disclose their NSFR levels semiannually beginning in 2023.

In 2012 and 2013, Goldman arranged and underwrote three bond offerings that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Certain former Goldman bankers in Asia participated in a scheme with Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho and others to divert substantial portions of the proceeds from the 1MDB offerings for their personal benefit and to pay bribes to certain foreign government officials. Goldman's transaction approval processes and internal controls failed to detect or prevent the scheme or to address obvious red flags around the 1MDB offerings.

The additional data, estimated from surveys covering 2012 through 2018, supplement the noncash payments overview provided by the top-line data released in December 2019. The FRPS Detailed Data Release includes new information about core noncash payments and some evolving areas of payments in the United States:  The estimated number and value of checks for 2018 are revised to 14.0 billion and $26.8 trillion, respectively. As a result, the estimated decline in the number of checks from 2015 to 2018 is revised to 8.2 percent per year, steeper than the previously reported 7.2 percent per year decline. The estimated decline in the value of checks is revised to 2.8 percent per year, less steep than the previously reported 4.0 percent per year decline. Use of alternative payment methods and services continues to grow. For example, according to estimates from processors, the number of payments via person-to-person and money transfer services more than doubled from 2015 to 2018. Wire transfers originated by consumers grew at double-digit rates by both number and value from 2012 through 2018.  The FRPS Detailed Data Release includes data from the Networks, Processors, and Issuers Payments Surveys (NPIPS) and the Depository and Financial Institution Payments Survey (DFIPS). NPIPS is a collection of surveys, each conducted as a census of the applicable organizations, including card networks and processors and issuers of core and alternative payment methods and services. DFIPS is a survey of a representative sample of insured depository institutions of different sizes and types that process payments. The Federal Reserve Payments Study is an ongoing effort to document aggregate changes in the payments system. The study has estimated national volumes across all noncash payment types every three years since 2000, with supplements providing national estimates for card payments and partial information on other payments for 2016 and 2017.

In particular, the minimum loan size for three Main Street facilities available to for-profit and non-profit borrowers has been reduced from $250,000 to $100,000 and the fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans. The Board and Department of the Treasury also issued a new frequently asked question clarifying that Paycheck Protection Program loans of up to $2 million may be excluded for purposes of determining the maximum loan size under the Main Street Lending Program, if certain requirements are met, which should also help smaller businesses access Main Street loans. The Main Street Lending Program supports lending to small and medium-sized for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the COVID-19 pandemic but lack access to credit on reasonable terms.

Examples of risks to operational resilience include cyberattacks, natural disasters, and pandemics. The ""Sound Practices to Strengthen Operational Resilience"" paper outlines practices to increase operational resilience that are drawn from existing regulations, guidance, statements, and common industry standards. The practices are grounded in effective governance and risk management techniques, consider third-party risks, and include resilient information systems. The paper does not revise the agencies' existing rules or guidance. The practices are for domestic banks with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets or banks with more than $100 billion in total assets and other risk characteristics.

The current edition includes detailed information on the strength of the banking system in light of the economic and financial stresses from the COVID-19 containment measures. Additionally, it describes current areas of supervisory focus from the Federal Reserve as well as how banks and bank supervisors have adapted to a largely remote working environment. Also on Friday, the Federal Reserve announced that it is updating the list of firms supervised by its Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) Program, which was established in 2010 to supervise the largest and most complex firms. In connection with this update, the Federal Reserve has clarified that so-called ""Category 1"" firms will be supervised in the LISCC portfolio and that it will accept input on the update. The definition will align the Board's supervisory framework with the new regulatory framework that took effect earlier this year. As a result, certain foreign banks with U.S. operations that have substantially decreased in size and risk over the past decade will move to the Large and Foreign Banking Organization supervision portfolio, where they will be supervised with other banks of similar size and risk. The portfolio move will have no effect on the regulatory capital or liquidity requirements of any firm. The Board will accept input until December 7, 2020. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20201110a.htm,Federal Reserve Board approves fee schedule for Federal Reserve Bank priced services,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the approval of fee schedules, effective January 4, 2021, for payment services the Federal Reserve Banks provide to depository institutions (priced services). The Reserve Banks project that they will recover 98.7 percent of their priced services costs in 2021. The Reserve Banks will maintain the current schedule of prices for payment services provided to depository institutions (priced services) in 2021, with the exception of a modification to the Check Services participation fee. While the Reserve Banks do not expect to recover fully actual and imputed expenses, including profit that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services, in 2021, they do expect to recover fully expenses over the long run. This approach recognizes the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic and offers price stability for customers facing unique challenges in 2021. The Reserve Banks estimate that the change to the Check Service participation fee will result in a 2.7 percent average price increase for Check Services customers. Fees will remain unchanged for the Reserve Banks' FedACH® Service, National Settlement Service, Fedwire® Funds Service, Fedwire® Securities Service, and FedLine® Solutions. The 2021 fee schedule for each of the priced services is available on the Federal Reserve Banks' financial services website at FRBservices.orgSM. The Board also approved the 2021 private-sector adjustment factor (PSAF) of $16.4 million for Reserve Bank priced services. The PSAF is an allowance for income taxes and other imputed expenses that would have been paid and profit that would have been earned if the Reserve Banks' priced services were provided by a private business. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 requires that the Federal Reserve establish fees to recover the costs of providing priced services, including imputed costs, over the long run, to promote competition between the Reserve Banks and private-sector service providers.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201118b.htm,Agencies announce dollar thresholds in Regulations Z and M for  exempt consumer credit and lease transactions,,2020.0,"WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Federal Reserve Board and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today announced the dollar thresholds in Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) and Regulation M (Consumer Leasing) that will apply for determining exempt consumer credit and lease transactions in 2021. These thresholds are set pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act that require adjusting the thresholds annually based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2020, the protections of the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $58,300 or less in 2021. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property (such as mortgages) are subject to the Truth in Lending Act regardless of the amount of the loan. Although the Dodd-Frank Act generally transferred rulemaking authority under the Truth in Lending Act and the Consumer Leasing Act to the Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board retains authority to issue rules for certain motor vehicle dealers. Therefore, the agencies are issuing these notices jointly. The attached notices will be published shortly in the Federal Register.

The threshold amount will be effective January 1, 2021, and is based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as of June 1, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the Truth in Lending Act to add special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, including a requirement that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the home's interior before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less and also provide that the exemption threshold will be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the CPI-W. If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.

The fact sheet highlights the importance of legitimate charities and nonprofit organizations having access to financial services and being able to transmit funds through legitimate and transparent channels, especially in the context of responding to the coronavirus. It also clarifies that charities and nonprofit organizations as a whole do not present a uniform or unacceptably high risk of being used or exploited for money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions violations, and that banks and credit unions must develop risk profiles that are appropriate for the risks presented by each customer. Additionally, it provides examples of customer information that may be useful to banks and credit unions in determining those risk profiles.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201120a.htm,Agencies provide temporary relief to community banking organizations ,,2020.0,"The federal bank regulatory agencies on Friday announced an interim final rule that provides temporary relief for certain community banking organizations related to certain regulations and reporting requirements as a result, in large part, of their growth in size from the coronavirus response. Community banking organizations are subject to different rules and requirements based on their risk profile and asset size. Due to participating in federal coronavirus response programsâsuch as the Paycheck Protection Programâand other lending that supports the U.S. economy, many community banking organizations have experienced rapid and unexpected increases in their sizes, which are generally expected to be temporary. The temporary increase in size could subject community banking organizations to new regulations or reporting requirements. With regard to the requirements covered by the interim final rule, community banking organizations that have crossed a relevant threshold generally will have until 2022 to either reduce their size, or to prepare for new regulatory and reporting standards. The rule applies to community banking organizations financial institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019. Community banking organizations with under $10 billion in assets may have fewer resources available to prepare and comply with previously unanticipated regulatory requirements, especially during a time of economic disruption. The rule will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, and comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

The announcements today by regulators in the United States and United Kingdom and by the benchmark administrator for LIBOR together lay out a path forward in which banks should stop writing new USD LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021, while most legacy contracts will be able to mature before LIBOR stops. ""Today's plan ensures that the transition away from LIBOR will be orderly and fair for everyoneâmarket participants, businesses, and consumers,"" said Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles. Under the proposal from LIBOR's administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) will consult in early December on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. LIBOR's regulator, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also issued a statement welcoming these developments. The FCA indicated it will, in coordination with US authorities and relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, consider whether and, if so, how to most appropriately limit new use of USD LIBOR by supervised entities in the UK, consistent with the FCA's objectives of protecting consumers and market integrity. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a statement explaining that the June 30, 2023 cessation date for which IBA is consulting would allow time for ""legacy contracts""âUSD LIBOR transactions executed before January 1, 2022âto mature. The guidance further notes that entering into new USD-LIBOR-based contracts creates safety and soundness risks. Given that, the banking agencies encourage banks to stop entering into those new contracts by end-2021. ""These announcements represent critical steps in the effort to facilitate an orderly wind-down of USD LIBOR,"" said John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in his capacity as Co-Chair of the Financial Stability Board's Official Sector Steering Group. ""They propose a clear picture of the future, to help support transition planning over the next year and beyond.""

The annual indexation and publication of these amounts are required by statute but will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero. For all net transaction accounts in 2021, the reserve requirement ratio was set to zero percent in March 2020; therefore, all net transaction accounts are exempt from reserve requirements. The reserve requirement exemption amount will be set at $21.1 million, up from $16.9 million in 2020, and is the amount of a depository institution's reservable liabilities that will always be exempt from reserve requirements. The low reserve tranche will be set at $182.9 million, up from $127.5 million in 2020, and is the amount of a depository institution's net transaction accounts that may be subject to a reserve requirement ratio of not greater than three percent (and which may be zero). A depository institution's net transaction accounts greater than the low reserve tranche may be subject to a reserve requirement ratio of not greater than 14 percent (and which may be zero). These annual adjustments to the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche are based on growth in total reservable liabilities and net transaction accounts, respectively, at all depository institutions between June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020. The Board also announced the annual indexing of two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency with which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. First, the agencies confirmed that weaknesses previously identified in the resolution plans for several large foreign banksâBarclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and UBSâhave been remediated. Second, the agencies finalized guidance for the resolution plans of certain large foreign banks. The final guidance modifies the proposed guidance, which was issued in March of this year, in several ways. The agencies tailored their expectations around resolution capital and liquidity, derivatives and trading activity, as well as payment, clearing, and settlement activities. The scope of the guidance was also modified to generally cover foreign banks in category II of the agencies' large bank regulatory framework. As a result, the guidance will apply to the 2021 resolution plans from Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank, and also to MUFG for its full plan due in 2024. And third, the agencies provided information for large foreign and domestic banks that will inform the content of their next resolution plans, which now are due December 17, 2021. In particular, these targeted plans will be required to include core elements of a firm's resolution strategyâsuch as capital, liquidity, and recapitalization strategiesâas well as how each firm has integrated changes to and lessons learned from its response to the coronavirus into its resolution planning process. The information applies to foreign and domestic banks in categories II and III of the large bank regulatory framework.

These facilities were temporarily established in March 2020 to ease strains in global dollar funding markets resulting from the COVID-19 shock and mitigate the effect of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad. Extensions to both facilities through March 2021 were announced on July 29, 2020. A further extension of these facilities will help sustain recent improvements in global U.S. dollar funding markets by serving as an important liquidity backstop. In addition, the FIMA repo facility will help continue to support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. The extension of the temporary swap lines applies to all nine central banks previously announced on March 19 and extended in July. These swap lines allow the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity in amounts up to $60 billion each for the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden) and $30 billion each for the Danmarks Nationalbank (Denmark), the Norges Bank (Norway), and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The FIMA repo facility will continue as originally announced on March 31 and similarly extended in July. Its further extension will allow approved FIMA account holders to continue to temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201217a.htm,Agencies release annual CRA asset-size threshold adjustments for small and intermediate small institutions,,2020.0,"WASHINGTONâThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today announced the annual adjustment to the asset-size thresholds used to define small bank and intermediate small bank under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations. The annual adjustments are required by the CRA rules. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. Those meeting the small and intermediate small institution asset-size thresholds are not subject to the reporting requirements applicable to large banks unless they choose to be evaluated as a large institution. Annual adjustments to these asset-size thresholds are based on the change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million. As a result of the 1.29 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2020, the definitions of small and intermediate small institutions for CRA examinations will change as follows:  ""Small bank"" means an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.322 billion. ""Intermediate small bank"" means a small institution with assets of at least $330 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.322 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.  These asset-size threshold adjustments are effective January 1, 2021. The agencies will publish the final rule in the Federal Register. In addition, the agencies will post a list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds on the website of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (https://www.ffiec.gov/cra).

In particular, alerts would be required for incidents that could result in a banking organization's inability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of a banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The proposed rule is intended to provide the agencies with an early warning of significant computer security incidents and would require notification as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after a banking organization determines that an incident has occurred. In addition, the proposal would require service providers to notify affected banking organizations immediately when the service provider experiences computer security incidents that materially disrupt, degrade, or impair certain services they provide. Comments on the proposal must be received within 90 days of its publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201218b.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases second round of bank stress test results,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday released a second round of bank stress test results this year, which showed that large banks had strong capital levels under two separate hypothetical recessions. ""The banking system has been a source of strength during the past year and today's stress test results confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy,"" said Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles. The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks can support the economy during economic downturns. The tests evaluate the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue, and capital levelsâwhich provide a cushion against lossesâunder hypothetical scenarios over nine future quarters. Earlier this year, the Board conducted its annual stress test and additional analysis in light of the COVID event. Those results found that banks generally had strong levels of capital, but considerable economic uncertainty remained. In response, the Board put several restrictions in place to ensure that banks would preserve capital, including suspending share repurchases and limiting dividends. With the restrictions in place, large banks have recently built capital, despite setting aside about $100 billion in loan loss reserves. This stress test includes two hypothetical scenarios with severe global recessions. The first scenario featured an unemployment rate that spiked to 12.5 percent and then declined to about 7.5 percent, while the second scenario included a peak unemployment rate of 11 percent followed by a more modest decline to 9 percent. Under both scenarios, large banks would collectively have more than $600 billion in total losses, considerably higher than the first stress test this year. However, their capital ratios would decline from an average starting point of 12.2 percent to 9.6 percent in the more severe scenario, well above the 4.5 percent minimum. All firms' risk-based capital ratios would remain above the required minimum. In light of the ongoing economic uncertainty and to preserve the strength of the banking sector, the Board is extending the current restrictions on distributions, with modifications. For the first quarter of 2021, both dividends and share repurchases will be limited to an amount based on income over the past year. If a firm does not earn income, it will not be able to pay a dividend or make repurchases. Additionally, the firms' capital requirements will not be reset at this time. With the current capital requirements and distribution restrictions in place, banks have built capital over the past year. The modified restriction will continue to preserve capital and ensure that large banks can still lend to households and businesses. The Board will continue to evaluate the resiliency of large banks and monitor financial and economic conditions. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201218c.htm,Federal Reserve Board votes to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) at the current level of 0 percent,,2020.0,"The Federal Reserve Board announced on Friday it has voted to affirm the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) at the current level of 0 percent. In making this determination, the Board followed the framework detailed in the Board's policy statement for setting the CCyB for private-sector credit exposures located in the United States. The buffer is a macroprudential tool that can be used to increase the resilience of the financial system by raising capital requirements on large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal future losses and when the banking organizations for which capital requirements would be raised by the buffer are exposed to or are contributing to this elevated risk--either directly or indirectly. The buffer could also help moderate fluctuations in the supply of credit. The CCyB is designed to be released when economic conditions deteriorate, in order to support lending and economic activity more broadly. The Board consulted with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in making this determination. Should the Board decide to modify the CCyB amount in the future, banking organizations would have 12 months before the increase became effective, unless the Board establishes an earlier effective date.

The 2020 audited Reserve Bank financial statements are expected to be published in March and may include adjustments to these preliminary unaudited results. The Federal Reserve Banks' 2020 estimated net income of $88.8 billion represents an increase of $33.3 billion from 2019, primarily attributable to a $27.1 billion decrease in interest expense associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions and a $5.3 billion decrease in interest expense associated with securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Net income for 2020 was derived primarily from $100 billion in interest income on securities acquired through open market operations--U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and GSE debt securities, $723 million interest income on securities purchased under agreements to resell, realized gains of $664 million on GSE MBS, and foreign currency gains of $1.5 billion that result from the daily revaluation of foreign currency denominated investments at current exchange rates. The Federal Reserve Banks realized net income of $405 million from facilities established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve Banks had interest expense of $7.9 billion primarily associated with reserve balances held by depository institutions, and interest expense of $711 million on securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Operating expenses of the Reserve Banks, net of amounts reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury and other entities for services the Reserve Banks provided as fiscal agents, totaled $4.5 billion in 2020.

The final rule is generally similar to the proposal. In 2019, the Board finalized a framework that sorts large banks into different categories based on their risks, with requirements that are tailored to the risks of each category. The Board's capital planning requirements for these large banks help ensure they plan for and determine their capital needs under a range of different scenarios. The rule finalized today reflects that new framework. In particular, firms in the lowest risk category are on a two-year stress test cycle and not subject to company-run stress test requirements. In a change from the proposal, the final rule applies capital planning requirements to large savings and loan holding companies that are not predominantly engaged in insurance or commercial activities.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20210121a.htm,Federal Reserve Board approves reappointment of Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents,,2021.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the approval of the reappointment of 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents and 11 first vice presidents, as previously made by their respective boards of directors.1 Each individual has been approved to serve a new five-year term beginning March 1, 2021. Under section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, all Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents serve five-year terms that expire at the end of February in years ending in 1 or 6. Presidents and first vice presidents who take office in intervening years are initially appointed for the remainder of the current term. Class B and C Reserve Bank directors who are not affiliated with a supervised entity are eligible to vote on appointment and subsequent reappointment actions for presidents and first vice presidents. ""The leaders of our Reserve Banks play a vital role in supporting the economic health of communities across our country,"" said Governor Lael Brainard, chair of the Board's Committee on Reserve Bank Affairs. ""Over the past year alone, this has been apparent in the many ways they have been engaged in the Federal Reserve's responses to the COVID crisis and the national discussion on systemic inequities. Reflecting these important responsibilities, the eligible Reserve Bank directors, with significant input from the Board of Governors and key stakeholders, have conducted a rigorous process to inform their reappointment decisions."" Reappointment decisions by Reserve Bank boards of directors, and subsequent approval by the Board of Governors of such actions, are informed by assessments of various relevant performance dimensions including the ability of their president to effectively lead the Reserve Bank, the president's performance in achieving the Reserve Bank's and Federal Reserve System's objectives, and the president's ability to effectively represent the Federal Reserve to the public. The performance appraisal of the first vice president considers strategic leadership of the Reserve Bank, with a focus on operational capacity and organizational strength, as well as contributions to System initiatives. Class B and C directors represent a wide range of business and community interests that are affected by Federal Reserve policies. They are therefore well-positioned to assess the contributions and impacts of the Bank, its programs, and its leadership across the respective District. In addition, each president's performance is discussed annually by the chair and deputy chair of each Reserve Bank board and the Board of Governors' Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs, and the performance of each first vice president is discussed by that group and the Bank's president.

Like the earlier extensions, this one will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply to their banks for PPP loans for their small businesses. To prevent favoritism, the Board limits the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their affiliated banks. However, these limits have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loansâespecially in rural areas. The SBA clarified last year that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits, and without favoritism. The Board's rule extension will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The extension only applies to PPP loans. The Board is providing the rule extension to allow banks to continue to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from prioritizing or providing favorable processing time to PPP loan applications from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer the rule extension accordingly. The rule extension is effective immediately and applies to PPP loans made through March 31, 2021. Comments will be accepted for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210212a.htm,Federal Reserve Board releases hypothetical scenarios for its 2021 bank stress tests,,2021.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday released the hypothetical scenarios for its 2021 bank stress tests. Last year, the Board found that large banks were generally well capitalized under a range of hypothetical events but due to continuing economic uncertainty placed restrictions on bank payouts to preserve the strength of the banking sector. The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks are able to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. The exercise evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their loan losses and capital levelsâwhich provide a cushion against lossesâunder hypothetical recession scenarios that extend nine quarters into the future. ""The banking sector has provided critical support to the economic recovery over the past year. Although uncertainty remains, this stress test will give the public additional information on its resilience,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. The hypothetical recession begins in the first quarter of 2021 and features a severe global downturn with substantial stress in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets. The U.S. unemployment rate in the ""severely adverse"" scenario rises by 4 percentage points from its starting point, reaching a peak of 10-3/4 percent in the third quarter of 2022. Gross domestic product falls 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2022, with asset prices dropping sharply, including a 55 percent decline in equity prices. The chart below shows the path of the unemployment rate:  This year, 19 large banks will be subject to the stress test. Smaller banks are on a two-year stress test cycle but can opt in to this year's test and must do so by April 5. Banks with large trading operations will be tested against a global market shock component that stresses their trading, private equity, and other fair value positions. Additionally, banks with substantial trading or processing operations will be tested against the default of their largest counterparty. A table below shows the components that would apply to each bank, as well as identifying which banks are on a two-year cycle, based on data as of September 30, 2020. The scenarios are not forecasts and the severely adverse scenario is significantly more severe than most current baseline projections for the path of the U.S. economy under the stress testing period. They are designed to assess the strength of large banks during hypothetical recessions, which is especially appropriate in a period of uncertainty. Each scenario includes 28 variables covering domestic and international economic activity.

The final rule amends Regulation EE (Financial Institution Netting) to apply netting provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) to certain new entities including swap dealers. The rule would also make minor clarifications to the existing activities-based test in Regulation EE to clarify how the activities-based test applies following a consolidation of legal entities. Sections 401-407 of FDICIA validate netting contracts among financial institutions. Parties to a netting contract agree that they will pay or receive the net, rather than the gross, payment due under the netting contract. FDICIA provides certainty that netting contracts will be enforced, even in the event of the insolvency of one of the parties. Regulation EE currently includes an activities-based test pursuant to which an entity can qualify as a financial institution for purposes of FDICIA's netting provisions if it is a market intermediary and, during the previous 15-month period, it engaged in financial contracts exceeding specified numerical thresholds. Consistent with FDICIA's goals of reducing systemic risk and increasing efficiency in the financial markets, the Board's final rule expands the definition of financial institution to ensure that certain entities qualify as financial institutions, including swap dealers and security-based swap dealers; major swap participants and major security-based swap participants; nonbank systemically important financial institutions; certain financial market utilities; foreign banks; bridge institutions; qualifying central counterparties; the Bank for International Settlements; foreign central banks; and Federal Reserve Banks. The final rule also clarifies that, following a consolidation of legal entities, the surviving entity can determine whether its financial contracts exceeded the numerical thresholds in the activities-based test by considering the aggregated financial contracts of the consolidated persons during the previous 15-month period.

The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disaster/4586 Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Texas Winter Storms. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, and apply judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructuring. In supervising institutions affected by Texas Winter Storms, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Texas Winter Storms. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Texas Winter Storms. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by Texas Winter Storms may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Texas Winter Storms that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements, if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Texas Winter Storms. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Texas Winter Storms.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210225a.htm,Agencies issue Shared National Credit Review,,2021.0,"Credit risk for large, syndicated loans has increased over the last year, according to the 2020 Shared National Credit (SNC) Review released by federal bank regulatory agencies today. The elevated risk is largely attributed to the effects of COVD-19. While risk has increased, many agent banks have strengthened their risk management systems since the prior downturn and are better equipped to measure and mitigate risks associated with loans in the current environment. The review, which evaluates the quality of large syndicated loans, was conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and reflects examination of SNC loans originated on or before June 30, 2020. The 2020 results provide additional analysis focusing on borrowers in five industries that were affected significantly by the pandemic: entertainment and recreation, oil and gas, real estate, retail, and transportation services. The 2020 SNC portfolio included 5,652 borrowers, totaling $5.1 trillion in commitments, up 5.0 percent from a year ago. Nearly half of the total commitments were leveraged loans. The percentage of ""non-pass"" loans, including special mention and classified SNC commitments, for the portfolio rose from 6.9 percent to 12.4 percent year over year. While U.S banks held nearly 45 percent of all SNC commitments, they held less than a quarter of non-pass loans. For leveraged borrowers operating in COVID-19 affected industries, non-pass loans rose from 13.5 percent to 29.2 percent year over year. Commitments to borrowers in COVID-19 affected industries represented about one-fifth of all SNC commitments. In response to the increase in loan risks, banks substantially increased their loan-loss reserves, and aggregate capital in the system has risen by nearly a percentage point since March of 2020. Supervisors will monitor the performance of this portfolio relative to the increased loss cushion established by banks during 2020. Note: This release was revised on July 30, 2021 to correct an error in the historical 2009 â 2018 data for the Financial and Commodities industries in Appendix C: Summary of SNC Industry Trends.     2020 SNC Program Review Report (PDF)       Media Contacts:   Federal Reserve Board Darren Gersh 202-452-2955   FDIC Julianne Fisher Breitbeil 202-898-6895   OCC Stephanie Collins 202-649-6870",20210225,361

The Federal Reserve System supports an inclusive financial system and understands the challenges inherent in providing access to credit and other financial services in traditionally underserved areas. The System remains strongly committed to identifying and carrying through all opportunities to support MDIs, consistent with its statutory mandates. The PFP program is the Federal Reserve's national MDI outreach program and implements efforts to preserve and promote MDIs. Since its creation in 2008, the program has provided MDIs with resources to help them operate in a safe-and-sound manner, adhere to laws that protect consumers, and meet Federal Reserve Board supervisory standards. PFP program staff engages with MDIs by conducting outreach and providing technical assistance, training, education, and convenings for MDIs. By law, the term ""minority"" means any Black American, Native American, Hispanic American, or Asian American. The System's definition of MDI is consistent with the statutory definition of ""minority bank,"" and states that an MDI is any depository institution where a majority of the voting stock is owned by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. In addition to institutions that meet that qualifying criteria, the System considers an institution to be an MDI if a majority of its board of directors consists of minority individuals and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority. In addition to the statutory provisions, the System's definition of MDI recognizes women's depository institutions, and will provide women's depository institutions with the same PFP resources as other MDIs. The System's definition of ""women's depository institution"" is consistent with the definition of this term in the Community Reinvestment Act, and includes any depository institution where a majority of ownership or a majority of revenue is held by at least one woman, and a significant percentage of senior management positions of which are held by women. The PFP website (www.fedpartnership.gov) is maintained as a primary resource for providing updates to MDIs and System supervisory staff concerning the program and any enhancements to it.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319a.htm,Federal Reserve Board announces that the temporary change to its supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for bank holding companies will expire as scheduled on March 31,,2021.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that the temporary change to its supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR, for bank holding companies will expire as scheduled on March 31. Additionally, the Board will shortly seek comment on measures to adjust the SLR. The Board will take appropriate actions to assure that any changes to the SLR do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements. To ease strains in the Treasury market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote lending to households and businesses, the Board temporarily modified the SLR last year to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and central bank reserves. Since that time, the Treasury market has stabilized. However, because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the SLR over time to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability. To ensure that the SLRâwhich was established in 2014 as an additional capital requirementâremains effective in an environment of higher reserves, the Board will soon be inviting public comment on several potential SLR modifications. The proposal and comments will contribute to ongoing discussions with the Department of the Treasury and other regulators on future work to ensure the resiliency of the Treasury market.

Firms with capital levels above those required by the stress test will no longer be subject to the additional restrictions as of that date. Firms with capital levels below those required by the stress test will remain subject to the restrictions. ""The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year's stress test will preserve that strength,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles said. After two rounds of stress tests last year, the Board found that large banks had strong capital levels, which provide a cushion against losses. However, due to economic uncertainty from the COVID event, the Board put temporary and additional restrictions on capital distributions. Those restrictions limit bank dividends and share repurchases to an amount based on income over the past year. Normally, a large bank's capital distributions are restricted principally by the Board's stress capital buffer, or SCB, framework. The SCB sets a capital target for each bank based on its individual stress test results, which requires the bank to hold at least enough capital to survive a severe recession. If a firm does not meet that target, automatic restrictions are imposed. If a bank remains above all of its minimum risk-based capital requirements in this year's stress test, the additional restrictions will end after June 30 and it will be subject to the SCB's normal restrictions. However, a bank that falls below any of its minimum risk-based requirements in the stress test will remain subject to the additional restrictions for three extra months, through September 30. If the firm remains below the capital required by the stress test at that time, the framework of the regular SCB regime will impose even stricter distribution limitations. For a bank that is not subject to the stress test this year and on a two-year cycle, the additional restrictions will end after June 30 and its SCB requirements based on the June 2020 stress test will remain in place. The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks can support the economy during economic downturns. The tests evaluate the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue and capital levels under hypothetical scenarios over nine future quarters. Results for this year's test will be released by July 1. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.",20210325,426

The automated process would eliminate the need for member banks to file applications to adjust their stock subscriptionsâexcept in the context of mergersâand would significantly reduce the annual reporting burden. Regulation I, which governs the issuance and cancellation of capital stock by the Reserve Banks, currently requires that a member bank apply to adjust its stock subscription at least annually and sometimes quarterly. A member bank determines its required stock subscription based on its capital and surplus (or total deposit liabilities for a mutual savings bank) as reported in the member bank's most recent Call Report. The Reserve Banks are developing software that will automatically pull the information needed to calculate member banks' required stock subscriptions from Call Reports and thereby automate the stock adjustment process. More specifically, the Board proposes that a Reserve Bank would adjust a member bank's stock subscription each time the member bank files a Call Report. The Board is also proposing to make explicit the existing Reserve Bank practice of requiring a surviving member bank apply to adjust its stock subscription before merging or consolidating with another bank. Finally, the Board is proposing two technical amendments to Regulation I and conforming revisions to the FR 2056 reporting form. First, the proposed rule would specify which Reserve Banks are responsible for receiving membership applications from banks located in U.S. territories and dependencies. Second, the proposed rule would state explicitly that a national bank that wants to convert into a state nonmember bank must promptly file with its Reserve Bank an application for cancellation of all its Reserve Bank stock.

Recent years have seen the introduction of new financial products and delivery mechanisms for traditional banking services, notably leveraging emerging technologies, including from institutions with novel types of banking charters designed to support such innovation. To facilitate these activities, some such institutions have requested access to the payments system offered by Federal Reserve Banks. To help achieve the goal of applying a transparent and consistent process for all access requests, as well as considering the ramifications for the broader financial system, the Board is proposing Account Access Guidelines for the Reserve Banks to evaluate such requests. These guidelines take into account the Board's legal authority and reflect an analysis of its policy goals.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210507a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on proposed changes to Regulation II regarding network availability for card-not-present debit card transactions and publishes a biennial report containing summary information on debit card transactions in 2019,,2021.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday invited public comment on proposed changes to Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) to clarify that debit card issuers should enable, and allow merchants to choose from, at least two unaffiliated networks for card-not-present debit card transactions, such as online purchases. The Board views these clarifications of Regulation II's existing requirements as necessary in light of information indicating that often only one network is enabled for such transactions. Additionally, the Board published today a biennial report containing summary information on debit card transactions in 2019. Regulation II implements section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). Among other things, the regulation requires that there be at least two unaffiliated payment card networks enabled on a debit card to process debit card transactions. At the time the Board promulgated Regulation II, the market had not developed solutions to broadly support multiple networks over which merchants could choose to route card-not-present transactions. Although technology has subsequently evolved to address these barriers, data collected by the Board and information from industry participants indicate that two unaffiliated networks are often not available to process card-not-present debit card transactions because some issuers do not enable two networks for those transactions. The absence of at least two unaffiliated networks for card-not-present transactions forecloses the ability of merchants to choose between competing networks when routing such transactions, an issue that has become increasingly pronounced because of continued growth in online transactions, particularly in the COVID-19 environment. The proposed revisions would clarify that card-not-present transactions are a ""particular type of transaction"" for which two unaffiliated payment card networks must be available. The proposed revisions would further clarify the responsibility of the debit card issuer in ensuring that at least two unaffiliated networks have in fact been enabled to comply with the regulation. The Board also published today a report on debit card transactions in 2019, including information on volume and value, interchange fee revenue, certain issuer costs, and fraud losses. The report is the sixth in a series published every two years as prescribed by section 920 of the EFTA and summarizes information collected from debit card issuers subject to the interchange fee standard in Regulation II and payment card networks. Key highlights are provided at the beginning of the report.

Like the earlier extensions, this one will temporarily modify the Board's rules so that certain bank directors and shareholders can apply to their banks for PPP loans for their small businesses. To prevent favoritism, the Board limits the types and quantity of loans that bank directors, shareholders, officers, and businesses owned by these persons can receive from their affiliated banks. However, these limits have prevented some small business owners from accessing PPP loansâespecially in rural areas. The SBA clarified last year that PPP lenders can make PPP loans to businesses owned by their directors and certain shareholders, subject to certain limits, and without favoritism. The Board's rule extension will allow those individuals to apply for PPP loans, consistent with SBA's rules and restrictions. The extension only applies to PPP loans. The Board is providing the rule extension for PPP loans made since March 31, and to allow banks to continue to make PPP loans to a broad range of small businesses within their communities. The SBA explicitly has prohibited banks from prioritizing or providing favorable processing time to PPP loan applications from a director or equity holder, and the Board will administer the rule extension accordingly. The rule extension, which is effective immediately, applies to PPP loans made from March 31 through June 30, 2021. The rule change will continue to apply if the PPP is extended, with the change ultimately sunsetting on March 31, 2022. Comments will be accepted for 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, nearly one-fourth of adults said that they were worse off financially compared to a year earlier, reflecting the economic fallout and distress resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve Board's report, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2020, which was released on Monday, found a larger share of adults were worse off in 2020 than in previous years of the survey. This change occurred broadly across the population, but not all groups fared similarly. Despite the increase in the share of Americans doing worse off financially, most believed they were still at least doing ""okay"" financially overall. Seventy-five percent of adults were either doing okay or living comfortably in November, which was unchanged from 2019 after having fluctuated through the year. However, not all groups have fared similarly through the pandemic, and persistent disparities in well-being across education and race remained. Adults with at least a bachelor's degree were much more likely to report doing at least okay financially (89 percent) than those with less than a high school degree (45 percent). This gap increased to 44 percentage points in 2020 from 34 percentage points in 2019. In 2020, less than two-thirds of Black and Hispanic adults were doing at least okay financially, compared with 80 percent of White adults and 84 percent of Asian adults. The gap in financial well-being between White adults and Black and Hispanic adults has grown by 4 percentage points since 2017. The report draws from the Board's eighth annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which examines the economic well-being and financial lives of U.S. adults and their families. The 2020 survey of over 11,000 adults was conducted in November of last year, offering a picture of how individuals were faring eight months after the onset of the pandemic. This year's report covers emerging issues brought on by pandemic-related disruptions and offers insights into how people viewed their longer-run financial circumstances, including how they relate to education, housing satisfaction, and retirement savings. ""This new survey gives us valuable details about the financial challenges families have faced during the pandemic,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle W. Bowman. ""Even as the economy has improved, we can certainly see that some are still struggling, especially those who lost their jobs and those with less education, many of whom fell further behind. Helping families and communities was a central goal of the Federal Reserve's response to the pandemic, and the SHED is providing valuable insight into the successes and ongoing challenges of Americans as they continue to experience its effects."" People who retained their jobs during the pandemic generally had stable or improving finances in 2020. However, those who suffered a layoff and an extended period of unemployment saw a deterioration of their financial circumstances. Layoffs during the pandemic were concentrated among workers with fewer financial resources, which further exacerbated pre-existing disparities in their financial well-being. Those who were laid off during the pandemic typically had a relatively small financial cushion to begin with, as less than two-thirds of those who were laid off said they were doing at least okay financially in late 2019, before experiencing job loss. The survey confirmed that the ability of parents to work was affected by disruptions in childcare and schooling. Twenty-two percent of all parents were either not working (9 percent) or were working less (13 percent) because of such disruptions. The 9 percent of parents who were not working translates into nearly 2 percentage points fewer adults who were working overall. The unexpected pandemic-related need for childcare particularly affected mothers, preventing them from entering or fully participating in the labor force. Black, Hispanic, and single mothers, as well as mothers with low incomes, were more likely not to be working or to be working less due to the disruption. Students of all ages were also affected by the pandemic since widespread school closures began in March 2020. Parents viewed online education less favorably than in-person education. Only 22 percent of parents of K-12 students taking online classes thought their youngest child was learning as much as they were with in-person classes, whereas 59 percent said they were not. Among college students taking classes online, 34 percent thought they were learning as much as they would in-person, compared with 43 percent who did not. Results from the survey reflect financial conditions in late 2020 during the pandemic and indicate the changing nature of families' experiences. Financial repercussions related to COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the Federal Reserve Board will continue to monitor them.

Technological advances are driving rapid change in the global payments landscape. The Federal Reserve is studying these developments and exploring ways that it might refine its role as a core payment services provider and as the issuing authority for U.S. currency. ""As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting monetary and financial stability and the safety and efficiency of the payment system,"" Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell said Thursday in a video message. ""In pursuit of these core functions we have been carefully monitoring and adapting to the technological innovations now transforming the world of payments, finance, and banking."" This technology also offers new possibilities to central banksâincluding the Fed. In particular, it enables the development and issuance of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. A CBDC is a new type of central bank liability issued in digital form. While various structures and technologies might be used, a CBDC could be designed for use by the general public. As the Federal Reserve explores the potential benefits and risks of CBDCs, the key focus is on whether and how a CBDC could improve on an already safe, effective, dynamic, and efficient U.S. domestic payments system in its ability to serve the needs of households and businesses. ""We think it is important that any potential CBDC could serve as a complement to, and not a replacement of, cash and current private-sector digital forms of the dollar, such as deposits at commercial banks,"" Powell said. ""The design of a CBDC would raise important monetary policy, financial stability, consumer protection, legal, and privacy considerations and will require careful thought and analysisâincluding input from the public and elected officials."" Powell announced that the Federal Reserve plans to publish this summer a discussion paper that will explore the implications of fast-evolving technology for digital payments, with a particular focus on the possibility of issuing a U.S. central bank digital currency. The paper will complement Federal Reserve System research that is already underway. The Federal Reserve System is focused on better understanding the full set of opportunities and risks associated with new digital payment mechanisms. More technically oriented projects, focused on specific tools and infrastructure, are underway at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Fed is also collaborating internationally in groups such as the Bank for International Settlements' CBDC coalition.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20210528a.htm,Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on proposed changes to its Policy on Payment System Risk that governs the provision of intraday credit,,2021.0,"The Federal Reserve Board on Friday requested public comment on proposed changes to its Policy on Payment System Risk (PSR policy) that governs the provision of intraday credit, or daylight overdrafts, to healthy depository institutions with accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks. The PSR policy establishes limits on the value of an institution's uncollateralized daylight overdrafts, which occur when a depository institution's Federal Reserve account is in a negative position during the business day. The Reserve Banks provide intraday balances by way of supplying temporary, intraday credit to healthy depository institutions in order to foster the smooth operation of the payment system. The PSR policy also allows institutions that might otherwise be constrained by those limits to request additional collateralized capacity. The proposal would modify the PSR policy to (1) expand access to collateralized capacity and (2) clarify the terms for accessing and retaining uncollateralized capacity. The proposal targets expanding options for higher levels of intraday credit capacity and does not propose any reductions of the current terms for providing uncollateralized access. Additionally, the Board proposes to modify the PSR policy and the Policy on Overnight Overdrafts to align them with the deployment of the FedNowâ  Service and its 24x7x365 payment environment.

""Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has run three stress tests with several different hypothetical recessions and all have confirmed that the banking system is strongly positioned to support the ongoing recovery,"" said Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles. All 23 large banks tested remained well above their risk-based minimum capital requirements and as laid out previously by the Board, the additional restrictions put in place during the COVID event will end. All large banks will be subject to the normal restrictions of the Board's stress capital buffer, or SCB, framework. The SCB framework was finalized last year and maintains strong capital requirements in the aggregate for large banks with an increase in requirements for the largest and most complex banks. It sets capital requirements via the stress tests, and as a result, banks are required to hold enough capital to survive a severe recession. If a bank does not stay above its capital requirements, which include the SCB, it is subject to automatic restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Board's stress tests help ensure that large banks can support the economy during economic downturns. The tests evaluate the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue, and capital levelsâwhich provide a cushion against lossesâunder hypothetical scenarios over nine future quarters. This year's hypothetical scenario includes a severe global recession with substantial stress in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets. The unemployment rate rises by 4 percentage points to a peak of 10-3/4 percent. Gross domestic product falls 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2022. And asset prices decline sharply, with a 55 percent decline in equity prices. Under that scenario, the 23 large banks would collectively lose more than $470 billion, with nearly $160 billion losses from commercial real estate and corporate loans. However, their capital ratios would decline to 10.6 percent, still more than double their minimum requirements. Also on Thursday, the Board corrected an error with the results for BNP Paribas USA from the June and December 2020 stress tests. As a result, the projected pre-provision net revenue, projected pre-tax net income, and projected capital ratios were corrected. For media inquiries, call 202-452-2955.

Those capital requirements ensure that the large banks tested will hold roughly $1 trillion in high-quality capitalâenough to survive a severe recession and still be able to lend to households and businesses. Large bank capital requirements are in part determined by the Board's stress test results, which provide a risk-sensitive and forward-looking assessment of capital needs.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210830a.htm,Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions affected by Hurricane Ida,,2021.0,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the state regulators, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Ida on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disasters. Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Ida. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, and apply judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructuring. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricane Ida, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Ida. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricane Ida. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Ida may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by Hurricane Ida that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Hurricane Ida. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Hurricane Ida.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210831a.htm,Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions affected by California Wildfires,,2021.0,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the state regulators, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of California wildfires on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities. A complete list of the affected disaster areas can be found at https://www.fema.gov/disasters. Lending: The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by California wildfires. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas should not be subject to examiner criticism. Institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and loan, and apply judgment, as not all modifications will result in a troubled debt restructuring. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest. Temporary Facilities: The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the wildfires. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by California wildfires. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter. Publishing Requirements: The agencies understand that the damage caused by California wildfires may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator. Regulatory Reporting Requirements: Institutions affected by California wildfires that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of California wildfires. The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm. Investments: Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by California wildfires. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.
